title: 'DOLLAR GENERAL'
courte_description: 'Discount store chain'
scenario_achat: '(August 2016 - $76.50) Leader similar to Dollar Tree Stores = discount. Stronger balance sheet. Superior long term potential, regularly buys back its shares with strong free cash flows. 76% of revenues from basic consumption (food) = less cyclical and steadier trafic. Affected in the short term by price pressure from Walmart and deflation. Solid balance sheet. Entry barriers: rural presence/domination, low costs, economies of scale and purchasing power. Stock deserves P/E similar to overall market, but premium to other retailers.'

title: 'MSC INDUSTRIAL DIRECT'
courte_description: 'Distributor of industrial supplies and products'
scenario_achat: '(March 2015 - $7). Quality company in attractive sector for the long term. Potential to consolidate a very fragmented market. Entry barriers somewhat high: number of offerred products, electronic platforms, national distribution network, ability to deliver in one day, private brands. Solid balance sheet. Margins currently under pressure due to lack of inflation and higher growth from national accounts. Short term growth prospects diminished by fall of petroleum prices, positive for the mid term. Potential to increase margins. Deserves a P/E in line with that of the overall market.'

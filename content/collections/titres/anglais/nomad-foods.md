title: 'NOMAD FOODS'
courte_description: 'European leader in the frozen food production and distribution'
scenario_achat: '(November 2020 - â‚¬19.73) Defensive stock. High barriers to entry (trademarks, production and distribution network, relationships with grocery stores). Generates substantial free cash flow. 9.2% share repurchase in September 2020 at US $25.50. Good balance sheet for the sector = approximately 2.8 X EBITDA. Positive organic growth and potential for acquisitions. Leaders have a lot of actions. Reasonable valuation. Deserves a P / E ratio similar to the market.'

courte_description: 'Operates one of the largest networks of convenience stores in the world'
scenario_achat: '(January 2002 - $0.81 adjusted for splits) Quality company in fragmented industry. Has shown its capacity to make judicious acquisitions and to integrate them efficiently. Barriers to entry = economies of scale and operations expertise. Management owns a lot of shares and has proven its ability to create value for shareholders. Generates substantial free cash flows. Industry affected little by changes. Stock deserves a valuation similar to the market.'

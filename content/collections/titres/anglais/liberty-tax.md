scenario_achat: 'not translated(February 2017 - $13.40) 2nd largest personal tax preparer in the US. Believe this market is here to stay even as more people use software. Attractive franchise-based business model. Importance of having a strong local presence, which is best assured by an owner. Competitive advantages over local players - economies of scale, reputation, software, brand name. Management team has a proven track record. Strong balance sheet. Low valuation. We believe the stock deserves a lower P/E ratio than the market.'

courte_description: 'Not translated'
scenario_achat: '(August 2017 - $51) Stock and sector carried away by Amazon fears. BIG is in our view in a harder-to-attack niche = inventory liquidation expertise. Logical strategy to add a range of recurring consumer staples. Furniture niche around 25% of revenues attractive and differentiated from the competition. Exc financial performance with President Campisi arriving in 2013. No growth in number of stores but sales per store +. Substantial discretionary cash flow = share buybacks. Discounted merit compared with the market as a whole.'

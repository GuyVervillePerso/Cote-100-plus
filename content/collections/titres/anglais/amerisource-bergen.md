title: 'AMERISOURCE BERGEN'
courte_description: 'Distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products'
scenario_achat: "(November 2017 - $81). Three players in the industry. High barriers to entry: economies of scale, regulations, client relations, national distribution network serves national clients. Difficult to sell directly to consumers due to RX and several payers involved. Largest client is Walgreen = 30% of revenues but Walgreen owns 26% of ABC's shares. Second client is Express Scripts at 16% of revenues, contract extended for 5 years. Strong financial health. Generates substantial free cash flows. Room for acquisitions. Management own 2.9 M shares. Stock currently depressed due to Amazon. Probably deserves a discount to market P/E."

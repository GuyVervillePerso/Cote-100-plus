courte_description: 'Specialty insurance company'
scenario_achat: '(03-2021, $1,140) Model that closely resembles that of Berkshire Hathaway = specialized insurance + equity investments + private companies (Ventures). Excellent management team who have demonstrated their integrity and prudence. Should continue to grow in insurance while achieving a combined ratio of less than 100% over the long term (probably close to 90%). Ventures is an attractive avenue that will grow in importance over the years. Very solid balance sheet. Should be 1.5X book value and / or approach our assessment of intrinsic value over the medium term.'

title: 'GROUPE CGI'
courte_description: 'IT contracts for business process outsourcing (BPO)'
scenario_achat: '(Mars 2008 - $8) Defensive sector. Generates large free cash flows. Offers services = technology agnostic. High revenue visibility afforded by large backlog. Depressed valuation due to technology correction. Growth by acquisition and/or stock buybacks. Management owns a lot of shares and has excellent track record of value creation. Deserves a P/E similar to that of overall market as slow revenue organic growth.'

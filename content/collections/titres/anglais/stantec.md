scenario_achat: '(February 2015 - $32) Business model reduces risks through diversification, large number of small contracts. No construction risk. Positive organic complemented by acquisition strategy. Expertise in integration of acquisitions. Fragmented industry. Generates large free cash flows - little capital expenditures. Mostly variable costs. Management has excellent track record to create value in the long term. Entry barriers = very diverse service offering, economies of scale, expertise. Stock deserves a P/E similar to the overall market.'

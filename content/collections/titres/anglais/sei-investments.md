title: 'SEI INVESTMENTS'
courte_description: 'Offers a wide range of management and administration services'
scenario_achat: '(January 2018 - $53) High-quality company. Compelling business model with highly recurring revenues. Very high switching costs for customers. Nearly perfect Balance Sheet with no leverage and high cash balance. Excellent track record of value creation and good capital allocation, high free cash flow generation. SWP platform developed at a cost of over $1.5 billion in the last 10 years reduces short term net income but offers good long term potential. The stock trades at a discount, deserves a premium to the market.'

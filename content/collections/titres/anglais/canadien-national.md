courte_description: 'Rail carrier'
scenario_achat: '(January 2012 - $38.25 adjusted for splits). North-American leader, most efficient of its industry. Activities less cyclical that we initially thought due to diversification by sector. Will probably win market share against trucking in the long term. Generates substantiel free cash flows even with large capital expenditures. Entry barriers very high. Will benefit from gowth of commerce with Asia. Deserves a PE slightly superior to that of the market.'

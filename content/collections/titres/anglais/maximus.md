courte_description: 'Consultant and manager of government programs'
scenario_achat: '(December 2019 - $74) Good business model with recurring revenues. North American leader in the management of government programs, mostly in the US but also in the UK and Australia. Excellent track record and strong balance sheet, even after a large acquisition in November 2018. Entry barriers : high switching costs, specialized expertise and long-held relations with governments. Long-term contracts insure stability of financials. Little cyclicality, even anti-cyclical, to some extent as several contrats to help unemployed get back to work and in healthcare. Main risks are the loss of contracts, the launch of large new contracts which are typically not profitable at the beginning. Generates important free cash flows. Slow but steady growth. Deserves a small premium to the market P/E.'

courte_description: 'Leader in the food sector'
scenario_achat: '(October 2017 - $43) Best operator in the Canadian grocery sector. Stock under pressure due to Whole Foods purchase by Amazon. Management team excel in capital allocation and have created a lot of value for shareholders. Revently announed acquisition of Jean Coutu appears logical and should contribute to EPS rapidly. Will remain in good financial health since could sell its Couche-Tard holdings. EPS could reach $3 with 12-month contribution from Jean Coutu. Stock deserves lower P/E than the market but premium to its sector.'

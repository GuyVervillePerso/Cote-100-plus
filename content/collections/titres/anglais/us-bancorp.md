courte_description: "One of the largest American banks\t\t\t\t\t\t"
scenario_achat: "(January 2008 - $28) Fifth largest US bank in terms of assets. One of the most conservatively managed bank - should not be too affected by the real estate market collapse. ROE of about 20% and low bad debt expenses compared to other large banks. Little private bank activity, which diminishes the banks's variability of results. Attractive dividend and constantly buying its shares with excess free cash flows. Deserves a lower P/E than the overall marlket but a premium valuation to other banks."

courte_description: 'Manufactures a wide variety of fruit and vegetable juices and drinks'
scenario_achat: '(January 2013 - $78.00) Quality company in less-cyclical sector. Management has show ability to create value and owns a lot of shares (family business). Recent acquisition of Clement Pappas attractive and opens door to US market. Balance sheet reflects acquisition but large free cash flows should reduce debt rapidly. Entry barriers = brands, client relations, distribution network. Industry remains fragmented, particularly in the US = future acquisitions. Deserves similar P/E than the overall market.'

title: 'CH ROBINSON'
courte_description: 'Freight transport logistics services'
scenario_achat: '(February 2013 - $ 57.00). World leader in logisctics services. Little capital needed as is an intermediary - owns little equipment. Entry barriers somewhat high: intl network (230 offices), relationships with thousands of shippers and suppliers. Growth potential as owns only about 3% market share. Trend towards logistics outsourcing by corporations. Excellent track record. High profitabilty and ROIC 20%+. Perfect balance sheet. Economies of scale becoming more significant. Stock deserves P/E above overall market.'

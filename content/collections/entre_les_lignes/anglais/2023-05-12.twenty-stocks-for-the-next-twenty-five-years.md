        text: 'This is the challenge launched by the family of Mr. Thomas Gayner, president of Markel, an American insurance company. The family is donating US$30,000 per year for 25 years to two investment clubs at two American universities. Each of these clubs will have to choose and buy between 15 and 25 stocks – and keep them without making any subsequent transactions – for 25 years. From year 26, half of the value of the first portfolio will be used to pay scholarships, the other half will be reinvested in the same way for the following 25 years and so on, year after year.'

        text: 'I find the concept very interesting! There are already many student investment competitions, but most aim to achieve the best returns during an academic year, a horizon of a few months, at most. The exercise is formative because it allows the students who participate to familiarize themselves with the stock market, but we cannot say that it promotes long-term investment. Yet, if there are investors who should take a truly long-term perspective, it is students who have nearly 50 years of investing ahead of them!'

        text: 'Among these companies, I would tend to favour companies that are well established, but not too big. Wal-Mart is probably one of the companies that would not be eliminated, but can we see high growth for the next 25 years for a company that today has revenues of more than US$600 billion?'

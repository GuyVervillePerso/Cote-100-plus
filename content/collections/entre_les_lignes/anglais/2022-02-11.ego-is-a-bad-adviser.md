        text: 'On the other hand, when a security that we acquired strongly corrects, our ego takes it in an equally personal way. A fall in the price of a security is automatically associated with a “loss”, which is then associated with a “failure”. An investor in that situation will tend to throw in the towel and say that the stock market is not for him. If he stays in the market, he might become overly cautious.'

        text: "The phenomenon reminds me of tennis. Many years ago, I decided to try to remain as phlegmatic as possible during a tennis match. I try to remain impassive, both when things are going well and I've just made a good move, and when things are going badly, and I've just made a big mistake. A tennis match is long (especially at my age!) and I think it's important to conserve your emotional energies by eliminating overreactions. When I was young, my idol was Bjorn Borg, who we called "

        text: 'The stock market fluctuates daily. Sometimes it will fluctuate wildly, up, or down. Imagine the investor who gets carried away every time the stock market goes up by 1% or 2% or who despairs every time the opposite occurs. He has not finished expending emotional energy! Is he well placed to make objective decisions under such conditions?'

        text: 'The fluctuations are even worse for specific stocks in your portfolio. Take for example a stock as defensive and conservative as Royal Bank, the largest company in the Canadian market: its stock has fluctuated between $105.10 and $149.60 over the past 12 months!'

        text: 'From one situation to another, you must try to eliminate all emotion and focus on your decision-making process. Go back to the reasons why you bought a stock: are they less, or even more valid than at the time of its initial purchase? Have there been any recent developments that might warrant the stock rising or falling?'

        text: 'As in tennis, there is another very good reason to keep calm on the stock market: it allows us to objectively analyze our mistakes and learn from them. By dissociating our ego from the return obtained from a stock, we give ourselves the opportunity to learn and make better decisions.'
chapeau: 'When a stock we bought appreciates, our ego swells. It takes all the credit for success when, most of the time, it is mostly luck. This unwarranted sense of confidence often leads to excessive risk taking by the investor and eventual failure.'

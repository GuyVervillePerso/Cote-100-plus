        text: 'If I look at the U.S. Nasdaq index, which is largely comprised of tech stocks, it peaked on November 22 and hit a recent low on January 28, correcting more than 18%. During the same period, the US government 10-year interest rate rose from 1.48% to 1.93%. These figures seem to support the negative relationship between interest rates and stock prices.'

        text: 'Indeed, it should be remembered that interest rate increases are not totally negative for the investor because, most of the time, they occur when the economy is running at full speed. It seems to me that this is the case now, as the robustness of the economy after the pandemic is leading to high inflation that the regulatory authorities are trying to control.'

        text: 'The sharp decline in the stock markets that occurred during the 1970s and that I noted above occurred during a different economic period, I feel, than the one we are currently experiencing. At the time, oil prices had exploded higher due to the embargo of the United States by OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries) and while the American economy was already reeling. Economists then spoke of a period of “stagflation”.'

        text: "I don't make short-term stock market forecasts. However, it seems that many observers only focus on the negative aspects of a rise in interest rates on the stock markets and forget that it is an expanding economy that leads to this rise in rates. It seems to me that nothing indicates that we are going through a period like that of the 1970s."
chapeau: 'Many observers attribute the recent stock market correction to the rise in interest rates over the past few weeks. Indeed, the rate offered by a 10-year US government bond is now 2.04% compared to just over 1.60% at the start of the year.'

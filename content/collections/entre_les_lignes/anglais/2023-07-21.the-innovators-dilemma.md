Therefore, cable shovel manufacturers had little or no interest in developing this new technology. Over the years hydraulic shovel technology improved and ultimately hydraulics surpassed cable shovel technology.'

        text: 'The case of Google and ChatGPT seems to me to be a good recent example of the innovator’s dilemma. For those unfamiliar with the tool, ChatGPT was introduced in 2022 by the OpenAI company and is an IT solution that can interpret and generate text to answer questions from its users. Although advanced, the technology offered by ChatGPT is still imperfect and several technological improvements are still needed. In my opinion, this technology illustrates the concept of a disruptive technology well.'

More importantly, I believe that the emphasis on this new technology risked cannibalizing Google’s revenue. Like Kodak, it was therefore probably caught in a dilemma where it had to decide between developing and deploying a still embryonic technology that did not meet the immediate needs of its customers or continuing to rely on the sale of highly profitable advertising.'

In closing, Google recently announced the launch of a solution like ChatGPT. We can speculate on the reasons that led Google not to deploy its solution first. Despite everything, its leaders had certainly faced the innovator’s dilemma.'

  In my blog last week, I explained that it is important for companies to fail intelligently in their quest for innovation. However, innovation is not an easy task to accomplish. In my opinion, many companies suffer from the innovator’s dilemma.

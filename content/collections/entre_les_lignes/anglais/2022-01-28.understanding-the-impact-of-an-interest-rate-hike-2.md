        text: "“In recent weeks, interest rates have risen significantly. For example, in Canada, the 10-year government bond rate is currently at 1.47%. You may tell me that it is still very low. Everything is relative in this world and the recent rate is more than twice that of last January (0.68%). In the United States, it's essentially the same phenomenon: the 10-year government bond rate is almost 1.55%, compared to 0.92% at the beginning of January and 0.64% at the beginning of last September."

        text: 'On that note, I thought I would talk about the importance of long-term interest rates in valuing stocks. Because, it bears repeating, the valuation of any financial asset, from works of art to bonds to real estate, is dependent on the general level of interest rates. The higher the interest rates, the lower the value of the assets and vice versa.'

It is for this reason that the value of a 30-year bond fluctuates much more than that of a five-year bond. This is also the reason why shares of companies on the stock exchange, which are also long-term assets, can be significantly affected by increases and decreases in interest rates.'

In the first case, the profits are relatively much more distant in time than in the second case.'

        text: 'This, in my opinion, is one of the reasons that would explain the fact that it is the unprofitable, start-up or fast-growing companies that have performed best on the stock market in recent months: interest rates had fallen significantly at the start of the pandemic and in the months following the first wave. In theory, the recent rate hike should have a similar opposite effect. In my opinion, this is a warning to investors who own securities of start-up companies or are not yet profitable.”'
chapeau: 'I recently received the statistics for my 2021 blogs on lesaffaires.com. It seems that the most viewed blog of the year was “Comprendre l’impact d’une hausse des taux d’intérêt” or “Understanding the impact of an interest rate hike”. Given the high inflation observed in recent months, interest rates have increased significantly, as evidenced by the following graph showing the evolution over the last six months of the rates offered by a 10-year US-government bond:'

        text: 'This reflex is probably useful and effective in most areas of endeavour. If you are an entrepreneur or a business executive, being inactive is probably not a good idea. Your days will be filled with talking to your employees, meeting (by videoconference!) with some of your customers or potential customers, fixing production problems, etc. Most of your actions should positively impact the value of your business, at least in the long run.'

        text: 'On the stock market, 98% of the time, it is preferable to do nothing, to "sit on your hands"! It goes against our natural instincts, but it''s usually the smartest thing to do. If you have a portfolio of quality securities that are reasonably priced, hold onto those securities and do nothing else!'

        text: "Why should you sell a stock because you think it's a little expensive? Security valuation is more of an art than a science and it is impossible to rate a business with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, beautiful companies are rather rare and they are worth a lot. When you manage to get your hands on one of them, you should aim to support it in its development for many, many years."

        text: "Selling a security usually incurs transaction costs (although investors increasingly have access to platforms that allow securities to be traded without commissions) and generally taxes. Also, after you've sold, you may have to make another decision, which is to buy another security. Will you be able to replace it with a security of at least the same quality? Often we sell a stock that we consider a little expensive in the belief that we will have the opportunity to buy it back for less in the future. My personal experience has taught me that this is far from always possible. And once you no longer have a stock in your portfolio, it becomes more difficult to closely follow the progress of the company. Also, the price at which we sold a security becomes in a way a psychological benchmark in our mind and it then becomes very difficult to convince ourselves to buy it at a higher price, even if its valuation became attractive again."

        text: 'Personally, I believe that an investor should minimize the number of decisions he makes in managing his portfolio. The securities he or she buys should be for a period of several years, even with the goal of never reselling them. Thus, this investor will have to take time to properly analyze the desired company, to ensure that the valuation he makes of it leaves him a significant margin of safety compared to the price he will pay.'

        text: 'The other 2% of the time represents periods of correction in stock markets or specific securities. These are the times when an investor should become much more active and attempt to take advantage of the general decline to add quality stocks to their portfolio. In our management at COTE 100, for example, we were particularly active between last March and June when the stock markets had corrected sharply due to the pandemic. To do this, the investor will try to always keep enough cash in the portfolio to buy one, perhaps two, securities when the opportunity arises.'

        text: 'Otherwise, the investor remains seated on his hands and resists the temptation to act. This does not mean that he remains totally inactive: he does research to identify quality companies that match his selection criteria and sets them aside pending a possible opportunity to buy them at good price. He also regularly monitors the companies that make up his portfolio to ensure that they continue to grow and that their long-term growth prospects remain attractive. Occasionally, this exercise will cause him to question one of his securities and may lead to the decision to sell it.'

        text: 'This is counterintuitive, but the more inactive an investor will be in terms of transactions carried out in his portfolio, the better its long-term performance.'
chapeau: 'I believe the hardest part for an investor is inaction. One always feels a pressure to move, buy or sell securities in the portfolio. Taking action makes us feel like we are moving forward.'

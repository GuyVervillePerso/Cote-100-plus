A big thank you also for all the invaluable lessons he has generously shared with everyone through letters to shareholders and Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings for over 50 years.'

        text: 'Integrity. Mr. Buffett built his fortune and Berkshire Hathaway, which is now worth nearly US$650 billion, by simply investing in quality companies at the right price and holding them for the very long term. He did not resort to debt, financial engineering, or risky bets. His success is based on a reputation built over decades and founded on honesty and honour.'

        text: "Continuous learning. Buffett has evolved throughout his long career, and he continues to do so at over 90. His decision a few years ago to invest a substantial percentage of Berkshire's stock portfolio in Apple is the best example of this, he who had shied away from tech companies in the past."

        text: "Modesty. Mr. Buffett, despite his great fortune, has always lived modestly (at least, for a billionaire). He still lives in the house he bought in 1958 in Omaha. The Berkshire head office, five minutes from Buffett's house, is very modest and definitely not attracting attention."

        text: "Confidence in oneself and in others. Buffett may be humble, but he's very confident in his abilities. He has never hesitated to go against the grain of general sentiment and invest heavily when he unearthed really attractive opportunities (for example, the acquisition of BNSF for the US$34 billion in November 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis). He also has great trust in the people he works with, giving a great deal of autonomy to the executives of companies owned by Berkshire."

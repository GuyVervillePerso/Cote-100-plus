        text: 'On the other hand, this type of investor doesn’t expect to do as well as the stock markets when they experience large gains. Unless the investor is prescient and is able to configure the portfolio for each type of market - a higher risk portfolio in anticipation of a bull market and a defensive portfolio in preparation for a bear market - the investor must choose sides. However, we’ve always bet more on a defensive portfolio in line with our objective of preserving capital. I personally believe this is the best way to invest for the long term.'

        text: 'As far as the choice of securities goes, that implies that we stick to the securities of companies that we understand well. We don’t touch certain sectors or industries in which we don’t have the required expertise. Thus, you will note that we don’t hold any securities of companies operating in the natural resources sectors. Nor do we hold shares of companies at the cutting edge of technology, either in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries or in those of information technology.'

        text: 'It also means that we only buy securities when we are confident that their price is significantly lower than our estimate of their intrinsic value. However, it’s rather rare that a security sells for a price significantly lower than its intrinsic value. With the stock markets being very competitive and the information readily available to anyone who wants to do a little research online, stocks are mostly traded at a price that reflects a reasonable estimate of their intrinsic value.'

        text: 'Occasionally, the price and the value of a security diverge considerably (sometimes the price is significantly less than the intrinsic value; other times the opposite is true). Such discrepancies are usually caused by very human factors related to psychology. Fear, greed, envy, pessimism, are all factors that make price not always aligned with value. It’s the role of a “value” investor to find the discrepancies and understand the psychological factors that could explain them.'

        text: "By buying securities at a price well below our estimate of intrinsic value, we’re looking for the best of both worlds: high potential return (if we're right) combined with modest downside risk (in case we're wrong)."

        text: 'Which brings me to building a portfolio. First of all, diversification is essential because it significantly reduces the risk level of a portfolio. As it’s impossible to predict, even under the best conditions, what is to come from an economic or geopolitical point of view, we try to balance our portfolios according to several factors: close to half of our holdings are defensive, the other half are growth stocks; half of our companies are multinationals that export a lot, the other half are domestic; almost half of our companies are affected by the pandemic and the other half are not too affected and are even benefiting from it.'

        text: "The last point is that we have to take into account the general situation of the stock markets. When the markets as a whole seem expensive to us and opportunities are scarce, it’s normal for the portfolio's cash level to increase somewhat (we generally will not go above 10% of a portfolio in cash). However, when the markets seem cheap to us and opportunities abound, we will invest all of our cash."

        text: 'At the moment, we have nearly 10% in cash in our various portfolios under management (and 90% invested in quality securities). We are confident that there will be opportunities in the months to come to invest this cash in quality securities at a price lower than our estimate of their value.'

        text: 'Building a defensive portfolio is a process that takes several years as it stems directly from our investment philosophy, forged over the past 30 years or so.'
chapeau: "Above all, we aim to preserve capital. For most “value” investors, it's when the stock markets fall sharply that they stand out. The primary objective of a “value” investor is to preserve as much capital as possible, regardless of the state of the stock markets. Before thinking of winning, “value” investors think of maintaining their position."

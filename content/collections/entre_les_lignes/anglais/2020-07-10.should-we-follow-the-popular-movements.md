        text: 'Many will remember the madness surrounding bitcoin. At the beginning of 2018, this word was omnipresent in the media of several countries. An analysis in Google Trends shows us that research involving the word bitcoin, experienced an increase in popularity in late November 2017. Interest in research reached its peak in the week of December 17, 2017 and then faded gradually.'

        text: 'This heuristic analysis technique shouldn’t be considered as an end in itself. Some might argue that it’s rather the rise or fall of financial assets that leads to an increase in interest and not the reverse, just like the paradox of the egg or the chicken. One thing is certain, the stock investor should beware of the importance which the media attach to certain events or news. Bubbles and crashes are often amplified by the media. This phenomenon is even more true today as technology makes it easier for us to access and propagate news.'

        text: 'Despite the deluge of information, the stock market investor must remain objective in his thinking. An investor who follows crowds may, in many cases, be disappointed with the outcome. As Mark Twain put it so well: "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect." By taking a step back, it becomes easier to determine whether the popularity movement is justified or not. This is in fact the approach we recommend at COTE 100. Our long-term view as well as our objective assessment of events allow us to adjust our strategy accordingly.'

You’ll be able to compare their influence on the financial markets. Here are some suggestions as food for thought: cannabis, cryptocurrency, petroleum and USO (United States Oil Fund). Good research!'

  In last week’s blog, we gave you a very quick introduction to Google Trends. This tool allows you to graphically follow the evolution of the interest associated with a keyword. More specifically, the tool records the frequency of use of a keyword on Google over a given period. We believe this tool helps visualize the impact that the media can have on the financial markets. To illustrate this point, let's use two recent examples, bitcoin and COVID-19.

        text: 'The question is very relevant. I myself am concerned about the environment and the climate change crisis. In fact, I believe our company is doing its part for the environment – our headquarters is LEED Gold certified, using a geothermal system since its construction in 2012. We recently added two electric charging stations for electric vehicles for our employees (for a total of four). We are considering adding solar panels to our building.'

        text: 'It is also an important consideration in the management of our portfolios under management. This is why we have not invested in the oil industry for several years. The environmental issue is integral to any investment decision we make. As long-term investors, we are convinced that any company that harms the environment does not have a very bright long-term future.'

We prefer those which, at best, are good for the environment, or at the very least do not affect it too much.'

  I recently received this question by email (C.R.):

  “Being very concerned about the environment and global warming, I would like to know why Cote100 continues to buy oil-related securities as well as Canadian banks which finance the development of Canada’s tar sands. Very large mutual funds have decided to exit this industry completely, why is Cote100 not doing the same?”

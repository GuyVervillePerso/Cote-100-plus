        text: 'I also saw several U-Haul equipment rental locations, all conveniently located and with their colours and logos prominently displayed. Speaking of which, last year, my son and I drove from Ohio to Florida, a drive of almost 20 hours. To pass the time, we counted the U-Haul equipment we passed on the road. At over 100, we threw in the towel.'

        text: 'I also had the opportunity to frequent a Sprouts Farmers Market grocery store on several occasions and was impressed by the quality of the products offered (mainly organic) and by the affordable prices. It seems to me that the demand will be growing for natural and organic products in the coming years.'

        text: 'I also keep my eyes peeled for potential investment candidates. For example, I visited a Costco store several times. Each time, I was overwhelmed by the store traffic, the quantities of goods purchased by customers and the speed of service at checkout. The same observation was true for Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants. It seems that the popularity of the Chipotle concept has not waned in many years.'

        text: 'However, there are at least two things to keep in mind about such field research. First, it is easier to do it for retail businesses or that sell consumer-oriented products or services.

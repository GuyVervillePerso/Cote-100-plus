        text: 'However, in tennis, you don’t win by cheating, at least not in the long term. We stay clean and away from illicit substances. We respect the rules of the sport — the referees, the spectators and especially our opponents.'

        text: 'There are however exceptions, players who despise the etiquette of the sport. Australian player Nick Kyrios comes to mind. Although he often puts on an entertaining spectacle, I find that he degrades the image of tennis by regularly giving up during his matches, often behaving like a clown and ridiculing his opponents.'

It’s an exercise which requires patience, discipline and knowledge. I also believe that long-term investing requires following its rules, its etiquette. I obviously have Warren Buffett in mind, whose actions have always been marked by great ethics and “'

        text: 'What I have observed on the markets for months, and especially for the last few days, saddens me and angers me. I’m thinking in particular of the stock market explosion of securities such as GameStop, AMC or Blackberry. These securities have been manipulated by a group of speculators for the sole purpose of driving up their price on the stock market and reselling them.

Such acts, which are more casino-like than investing, are precisely those that give the stock market and the financiers who operate in it a bad reputation. I am convinced that the speculative wave leading to “day traders” will end badly and that many of them will abandon the stock market for good in the next few years, as we saw in the aftermath of the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s."

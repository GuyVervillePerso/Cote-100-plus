        text: "Let me give you an example among the thousands that exist: Couche-Tard, in which we have been shareholders since 2001. I believe that the stock has practically everything to appeal to investors: an exceptional track record, both in terms of earnings growth as well as the appreciation of its stock over many years, a solid balance sheet, an attractive market and one that offers attractive growth opportunities and, finally, a reasonable valuation. According to our internal data, the company's earnings per share went from US$0.03 in 2001 (April) to US$1.98 in its last fiscal year. Meanwhile, the stock's price has gone from nearly $1.00 a share to its recent price of nearly $45.00. I would also add that the company’s management have demonstrated time and time again that they are excellent operators and unparalleled integrators of acquired businesses."

        text: 'But as is always the case when considering a stock for investing, there are risks and challenges that the company will have to overcome in the future. This is true for all securities, but it’s especially true for a security that trades at reasonable valuation ratios and significantly lower than those of the markets as a whole. Couche-Tard shares are trading at less than 17.3 times the expected earnings per share for the next fiscal year, compared to an average earnings per share ratio of about 21.0 for the S&P 500.'

The owner of an electric vehicle will likely have less reason to go to a Couche-Tard convenience store, 46% of gross profits came from the sale of gasoline in the last fiscal year. Quebec has just announced that no new gasoline-powered cars can be sold in the province as of 2035. The state of California, a much larger market than Quebec, made the same announcement last September. In Norway, nearly 10% of the country's cars were electric in October 2018. In 2019, 55.9% of cars sold there were electric."

For example, an autonomous car could very well refuel on its own, without the participation of its owner, which would certainly reduce the demand for merchandise available in stores.'

And that’s without considering all the risks that we don’t even know and that could arise at any time - what Donald Rumsfeld had called "the unknown unknowns". It’s true for Couche-Tard and I bet it’s true for any company you have in your portfolio.'

chapeau: 'It’s impossible to be 100% certain that a stock will be successful in the future. If you think otherwise, I suggest you go back to your drawing board. If anyone presents you with such an investment, you should be very skeptical. The world is uncertain and it’s impossible to predict the future with precision.'

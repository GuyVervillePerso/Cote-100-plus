With this drop in Carvana’s stock, it becomes much more difficult for the company to fund its business (and its losses) on favourable terms… CarMax, on the other hand, has no need for external capital to continue its growth.”'

        text: "Six months later, Carvana's stock is down nearly 98% from its August 2021 peak. In fact, the company's market value has fallen from around US$60 billion a year ago to nearly $1.3 billion today. As of September 30, 2022, Carvana's balance sheet showed net debt of around $7.1 billion, while its free cash flow was negative $1.04 billion since the start of the year. In my opinion, one of Carvana's main competitors, CarMax, whose stock we own in certain portfolios managed by COTE 100, is likely to benefit from Carvana's financial worries in the coming quarters."

        text: 'Indeed, in recent months, access to capital has become much more restricted for businesses. The enthusiasm for share issues or new public offerings (IPOs) shown by investors last year has all but disappeared. In addition, issuing debt is still an option, but the terms are much less advantageous for companies, particularly those that are already quite indebted and whose activities are loss-making.'

Such companies could well take advantage of the current conditions to gain market share against their weakened competitors. They could also take advantage of the situation to make acquisitions at bargain prices.'

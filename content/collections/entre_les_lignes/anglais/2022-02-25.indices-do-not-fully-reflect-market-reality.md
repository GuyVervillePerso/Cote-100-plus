        text: 'On the one hand, at the end of last December, the shares of Apple (representing 11.37% of the index), Microsoft (9.85%), Amazon (6.60%) and Alphabet (its two classes of shares combine a weight of 6.99%), four securities among the approximately 3,300 of the Nasdaq index have a combined a weighting of 34.8%. However, these four securities show an average drop of “only” 15.7% since their recent peaks. This means that the vast majority of securities listed on the Nasdaq have suffered much larger declines than those of these four securities.'

        text: 'In short, even though the main US stock indexes have posted marked declines in recent months, a large majority of North American securities have fallen significantly more than these indexes. Even if the media speaks of a “correction”, the reality experienced by most investors is that of a real bear market.'
chapeau: 'At the time of writing, at the close of the markets on February 22, the American markets were officially in a “correction”. The definition of a correction is a 10% decline from a recent high; a 20% decline from a recent high is called a bear market. These purely technical terms make it easier for journalists to comment on stock market declines.'

        text: 'They are not simple questions because I believe that the answer should vary according to each investor’s profile. However, I will try to answer for the long-term investor, one who has an investment horizon of 10 years or more. And who is able to tolerate the inevitable corrections that occur from time to time on the stock markets.'

        text: 'The investor is torn at all times between two opposing desires: that of fully participating in the rise of the markets and the desire to protect themselves from any possible correction. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to play both hands at the same time.'

        text: 'Why? Simply because it allows us to jump on any investment opportunity that may arise without being forced to sell something else. Sometimes, opportunities arise during general market corrections and it can be difficult to sell a security that has suffered a correction in order to buy another.'

        text: 'Second, it happens on occasion that our cash will increase somewhat above the equivalent of an investment position. This happens when markets become relatively expensive and deals become scarce. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not because we want to increase our cash, but rather because we can’t find attractive investment opportunities. This is somewhat the case now. The fact remains that our objective is constantly to find securities that meet our quality and valuation requirements in order to invest all of our cash.'

        text: 'I believe it’s a serious mistake for any long-term investor to have substantial cash in his portfolio, which would represent, say, more than 10% of his portfolio. Given that he is getting an anemic interest return on this cash, his objective should be to invest it in securities.'

        text: 'The decision to invest part of one’s savings in the stock market should be a commitment for the very long term. Therefore, what we commit to investing in the stock market should remain invested at all times, for many years, without interruption. I recommend always keeping a little cash (the equivalent of one position), but never more than two positions.'

        text: 'As proof, since its low reached in February 2009, the flagship American S&P 500 Total index, which takes dividends into account, has posted an annual compound return of 18.58%! This is a far greater return than the nearly 10.0% compound annual rate of return it has recorded over the past 100 years or so.'

        text: 'Remember that an annual compound return of 18.58% means you double your capital value in less than four years (rule of 72). Also remember that Warren Buffett, arguably the best investor of modern times, has earned an exceptional annual return of almost 20% over a period of more than 50 years. Do you really believe that the S&P 500 can sustain compound annual growth of over 18% for several more years?'

        text: "Many natural phenomena are dictated by what one might call “the mean reversion”. On the stock market, you will observe it constantly: the stock that posted the best market performance last year may very well have a poor year next year and vice versa. A company's very high profit margins will attract competition, which will put downward pressure on those same margins. The sector that has been the subject of strong investor enthusiasm for some time will inevitably lose its appeal over time."

        text: 'Therefore, I believe an investor should be cautious about the exceptional stock returns of the past few years. On the one hand, he should be grateful and congratulate himself for having been part of it. But on the other hand, he should remember that the returns of the past 12 years have been nothing short of exceptional and they certainly cannot continue indefinitely.'

        text: "After several years of exceptional returns and assuming that future stock returns will approach the long-term historical average of almost 10% per year, future returns must necessarily be less than 10% in the years to come. At least that's what the mean reversion phenomenon teaches us."

        text: 'This is why I believe that an investor should remain cautious about the stock markets, stick to quality securities at a good price, diversify his portfolio well and avoid the use of margin or options strategies. This is also why he should make conservative projections of returns for the years to come.'

chapeau: 'When markets have been appreciating for a long time, more and more people are inexorably drawn to them. The stock markets have definitely recorded strong growth since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. There have been a few episodes of corrections, in particular the sharp drop experienced in the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the stock market performance of the North American indices has been extraordinary.'

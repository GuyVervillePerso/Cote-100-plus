He tends to imply, and you have to know how to read between the lines to understand his perception of the markets. This time, it seemed obvious to me that Mr. Buffett considers the markets rather expensive and that he does not find much of an interest in them. He also seems rather concerned about what's happening in the world."

We saw this during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when the company invested substantial sums in several companies (Mars, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Dow Chemical). Under “normal” market conditions, it becomes increasingly difficult for the company to invest substantial sums."

chapeau: "Here are some elements that I consider the most notable from the Berkshire Hathaway 2024 annual meeting, after rereading the approximately 15 pages of notes that I took during the more than six hours of the meeting. That included nearly five hours during which Messrs. Buffett, Greg Abel (Berkshire Hathaway CEO and vice chairman of all the company's non-insurance businesses) and Ajit Jain (vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway's insurance businesses) answered numerous questions from shareholders, alternating questions from people on site and those which had been submitted before the meeting in writing."

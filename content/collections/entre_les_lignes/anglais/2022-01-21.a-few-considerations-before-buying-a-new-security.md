        text: "The catch is that the stock we should have sold has been in the portfolio for several years and has performed strongly since it was acquired, which means significant tax liabilities for many of our clients. For example, I looked at a specific client's portfolio to get a sense of the tax issue. For this client, the existing security has appreciated by more than 185% of its book value (the security is held in a taxable account); selling it would produce a substantial realized gain tax."

        text: 'Such unrealized gains and the taxes they entail are not necessarily a reason not to sell an existing security, but they do raise the bar significantly for replacing it with another security. For example, in our assessment of the candidate stock, we determined that it was undervalued by the market by just over 20%. As for the existing stock, we estimate that it is undervalued by almost 10%. Do these yield differences justify a substitution?'

        text: "Let's see using a base of $100 for calculation purposes and a marginal tax rate of 50%. Selling the existing security would have yielded after-tax proceeds of nearly $239 ($100 originally invested is now worth $285 [185% appreciation], minus estimated taxes of $46 on the gain of $139 = $239). If we reinvest this sum in the new security and obtain the expected return of 20%, we will find ourselves in one year with a market value of $287 (incidentally, roughly the current value of the existing security). On the other hand, if we keep our shares of the existing security and it achieves the expected return of 10% over the next 12 months, we will end up with a value of $313."

        text: 'I would add that we must also consider the fact that, in general, we know the company that we have had in our portfolio for several years much better than that of the new coveted company. In terms of risk-taking, it often makes more sense to stay with a stock that you know well than to buy a new, less well-known one.'

chapeau: 'One of my great passions is combing the stock markets to find investment opportunities. It is a long job that is often frustrating, but how rewarding when you finally find a good opportunity. Indeed, in a well-valued stock market, it is often necessary to analyze hundreds of potential securities before finding just one that meets our selection criteria.'

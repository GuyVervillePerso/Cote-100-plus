        text: '1. The stock market is unpredictable and short-term forecasts are worthless. Go back to early 2020 and everything seemed to be looking good for investors. Who could have predicted that a pandemic would completely change the look of the planet in a matter of weeks? A lot of people will present their forecasts for the next year to you —obviously, forecasts usually only extrapolate the recent past and, by definition, cannot take into account unforeseeable events that may arise in the future. 2020 will remind us that the investor must be constantly on guard and ready for any eventuality.'

        text: '2. The market is abnormally concentrated and it is dangerous. In my opinion, the flagship index of the US stock market, the S&P 500, has historically been the most representative of the North American economy as it is made up of nearly 500 of the largest American public companies, representing each of the economy’s major industries. However, 2020 and the last few years have changed this somewhat. At the end of 2020, six companies in the S&P 500 Index (Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix, Google (Alphabet) and Microsoft) made up almost 25% of the index. In addition, their exceptional stock market performance in 2020 contributed nearly 75% of the performance of the S&P 500 during the period. Personally, such a concentration of an index and performance spells "DANGER".'

        text: '3. Diversification takes on its full value in difficult conditions. At the worst of the market downturn in 2020, when the vast majority of stocks were down sharply, some more defensive stocks held up very well. I personally believe that an investor should aim for a balance in their portfolio between defensive stocks and growth stocks.'

        text: '6. Very expensive stocks can become even more expensive. At the beginning of the year, I felt that a stock like Tesla was way too expensive for the long-term investor. However, the stock was one of the big winners of 2020 with a return of 743%! I pity those who might have been tempted to sell the security short. I conclude that securities that are expensive can get even more expensive (which is not a valid reason to buy them).'

The historically low interest rates and the untold sums that have been pumped into the economy by Western governments to get it through the pandemic are a very powerful driver for the value of any financial asset, including that of the stock market.'

        text: 'On the one hand, not all investors understand that the stock market is a forward-looking system; it’s constantly adjusting to what could happen in the coming months. The stock market is said to be looking six months ahead; I think that’s about right.'

        text: 'Some investors tell me that the market has not stopped losing value yet. According to them, the spread of the virus, which will inevitably occur in the coming weeks, and the marked increase in cases of infection and complications leading to death will further correct the stock market.'

        text: 'On the other hand, during a bear market, the stock market ends up reaching a low before eventually rebounding. By the time the stock market reaches a bottom, which can only be identified in hindsight, a large number of investors will have reached the stage of capitulation already. When many investors conclude that they’re definitely not made to invest in the stock market and that they will throw in the towel for good, we’ll probably have reached the bottom of the stock market. This is precisely what happened during the 2008-2009 crisis, as well as in the aftermath of the technology bubble in 2001 and in the years that followed.'

        text: 'The stock market has this somewhat perverse mania to regularly go through particularly uncertain and trying episodes. With each of these episodes, it forces less experienced investors to abandon it for more "safe" investments. Those who resist the urge to leave will eventually emerge stronger, more experienced and more convinced than ever that the best way to invest is to buy quality companies at a reasonable price and to remain invested in the stock market for the very long term.'

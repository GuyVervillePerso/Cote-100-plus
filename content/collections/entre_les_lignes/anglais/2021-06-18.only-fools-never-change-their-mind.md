        text: 'Over the years, his outlook changed, and he started to pay particular attention to the quality of a company, to the sustainability of its business model. Mr. Buffett often repeats that it was thanks to his long-time partner, Charlie Munger, that he adjusted the way he invests.'

        text: "I believe that one of Berkshire Hathaway's first investments that confirmed its new focus on quality businesses was its purchase of See’s Candies, a candy and chocolate maker, acquired in 1972 for US$25 million. See’s had already developed a recognized brand in California and had a loyal following. In addition, the company’s business model required little capital and generated significant free cash flow, while achieving high profit margins. In Berkshire Hathaway's 2019 annual letter to shareholders, Buffett mentioned that See’s Candies had generated pre-tax profits of over $2.0 billion for Berkshire since its acquisition in 1972."

        text: 'Then, Berkshire Hathaway acquired all of the remaining shares of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) in 2010 for nearly US$34 billion. To my knowledge, prior to this investment, Berkshire had never invested in the railway industry. Here again, Buffett relied on the particularly high barriers to entry in the industry and the sustainability of BNSF’s business model.'

        text: "More recently, Buffett surprised many as Berkshire Hathaway became one of Apple’s largest shareholders. The company now owns more than 5% of the shares of this technology company. Yet Buffett had always said that technology was outside his area of competence! However, as of December 31, 2020, the cost of Berkshire Hathaway's investment was nearly US$31.1 billion while its value was US$120.4 billion, a capital gain of nearly US$90 billion."

        text: "The evolution of Buffett's way of investing is remarkable and I think it sets an example for investors to follow. For our part, about two years ago, we made the strategic decision to broaden our horizons and no longer exclude the securities of foreign companies in our investment universe. Yet we had always said that we would rather invest in North American companies that do business internationally rather than invest directly in foreign companies. "

        text: 'I would add that if you want to gradually expand your circle of expertise as an investor, you have to be prepared to step out of that circle somewhat – this is the only way to keep improving. The decision to expand our horizons internationally has allowed us to find a few quality companies at good prices in recent years. Only fools never change their mind.'
chapeau: 'One of the things I admire the most about Warren Buffett is that he has been able to adapt and adjust the way he invests over the many decades of his career as an investor. Initially, in the 1950s, he was very successful investing in securities with a lot of "value", securities that he could buy at $0.50 when he valued them at $1. This was essentially the method instilled in him by his mentor and teacher, Benjamin Graham. At the time, Buffett didn''t pay much attention to the quality of a company, as long as he could buy the stock at a steep discount to his estimate of its intrinsic value.'

Some will also take the time to provide details of the strategies the company is employing to continue to grow. It is this information that interests us most since the strategies and their execution typically influence long-term business performance.'

Specifically, it had 100 restaurants in Canada, 100 in the United States and 40 internationally. One could find a restaurant in Ecuador, one in Austria and three in Saudi Arabia, among others. It also sold its products in sports stadiums and on airplanes. The company didn't seem to know where to prioritize growth."

While they can sometimes be very profitable from an investment standpoint, few turnaround situations succeed. In fact, Warren Buffett himself admits that investing in turnarounds is very complex and difficult. The restaurateur referred to in this text is currently in a turnaround situation, an investment situation that is probably best to avoid.'

The investor who would have been able to identify the restaurant owner's strategic problems right at the beginning could have avoided investing in this company, which has lost nearly 85% of its value since its IPO."

  For many, the months of July and August are synonymous with vacation. For the COTE 100 investment team, those two months are one of the busiest times of the year. During this period, a very large number of companies publish their quarterly financial results. Over the past few weeks, therefore, we have spent a lot of time reading transcripts of conference calls.

        text: 'I also believe they read a lot of books. This is the case with Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett''s long-time partner in Berkshire Hathaway, who once said his children consider him a "book on legs" because he has a book in his hands all the time. Apparently, he is particularly fond of biographies, which have not only taught him what it takes to be successful, but most importantly not to repeat the worst mistakes of others.'

For the past few years, I've been listing these books and giving them a \"RATING\" out of five stars (it's a real obsession in the family!). While many of the books I read don't teach me specific investing lessons, I believe most of them, regardless of subject, help broaden my horizons and make me a better investor."

        text: " (★★★★★). I particularly enjoyed this book, which contains many lessons on investing while using an angle that I have rarely seen in other books on this topic. I humbly admit to you that I have been working on a book about investing for over five years and that many facets of Mr. Baid's book resemble those of my book. So maybe I'm a bit biased, but I really enjoyed reading (and re-reading) this book. In his book, Baid writes, "

It is particularly refreshing that the author is optimistic that we will be successful in tackling the climate challenge, but realistic enough to point out that colossal and swift efforts are required to get there.'

chapeau: 'One of the characteristics of the best long-term investors is that they are for the most part not very active on the stock markets, trading very few securities in a year. What can they be doing with their time? They mainly spend it reading. They read annual reports from companies, which gets them to know them well and prepares them to jump at the first possible opportunity to buy their stock, a process that can take years. They also read financial newspapers and magazines, which helps them to stay abreast of the major changes in the world and to occasionally identify some investment opportunities.'

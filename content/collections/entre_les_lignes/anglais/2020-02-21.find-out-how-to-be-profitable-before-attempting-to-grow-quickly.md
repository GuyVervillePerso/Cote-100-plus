The model of many companies is contrary to what Mr. Christensen recommends as they are first aiming at increasing their income as quickly as possible in the hope that one day it will translate into profits. It may be the legacy of companies like Amazon, which lost a lot of money for a long time before becoming the phenomenal success we know.'

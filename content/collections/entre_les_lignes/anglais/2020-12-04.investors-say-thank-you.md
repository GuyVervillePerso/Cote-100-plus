        text: "First, would you seriously have believed that the stock markets would have seen a rise this year as the planet was hit by a global pandemic that has infected millions of people and brought the planet's economy to its knees? As of this writing, the US S&P 500 Index is up 13.5% (excluding dividends) since the start of the year. It's true that the Canadian S&P/TSX is up just 2.0% (excluding dividends), but I wouldn't want to sound like a “party pooper”!"

        text: "Today's investor has a host of very low-cost financial products available. When I first started investing in the early 1990s, most investors put their savings in mutual funds that charged almost 2% management fees. In addition, most of the time, an initial sales commission of 6% to 8% was received by the seller of the fund. Today, the investor has the choice of investing in all kinds of index funds with management fees as low as 0.1%. And for the self-directed investors who choose to invest in stocks themselves, they can now do so for absolutely no commissions! I remember back in 2000 it cost a minimum of $40 in commission to trade a security with a discount broker. That’s without considering modern means and technology! Today, an investor can buy or sell stocks at any time with just one click on their smartphone."

        text: "Speaking of technology, I read this morning that the vaccine developed by BioNTech in collaboration with Pfizer has been approved in the UK. Isn't that just amazing! How many experts said a few months ago that a vaccine would take at least three years to develop and administer. I know we’re still a long way from inoculating the majority of the world's population, but it seems to me that investors and the general public should celebrate this scientific achievement."

        text: 'Furthermore, if the world economy experienced the throes of the Great Depression of the 1930s, in my opinion it’s because Western governments and their leaders had not yet learned keynesianism, developed by economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, that governments must intervene to revive a struggling economy by injecting capital. That’s what they did during the 2008-2009 crisis and it’s still what they’re doing now to get us out of the COVID crisis. We can thank Keynes and the US Federal Reserve.'

        text: 'Today, the investor has access to unimaginable information about the stock markets and the companies they want. When I first started in the business, we either had to call or write to companies to have their annual reports mailed to us. Today it takes just a few clicks to access all annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy circulars, presentations, press releases, corporate presentations, conference call transcripts and more. It’s the information Klondike and it’s free.'

        text: "Investors today also have several models of the investment world to follow. Consider the wealth of advice and information that comes to us from Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports. Or the chance to learn the philosophy of value investing by reading ‟The Intelligent Investor” by the father of fundamental analysis, Benjamin Graham. We all can be better because of the many great investors who have not only led the way, but generously shared their expertise. Here I take the liberty of ‟plugging” ‟La Bourse ou La Vie” written by Guy LeBlanc and to which I contributed."

chapeau: "Our American neighbors just celebrated Thanksgiving. Having spent a few years studying in the United States, I’ve always been blown away by the importance of this holiday, possibly the most important of the year. It's a chance for the whole country to get together as a family, eat the traditional turkey and watch two or three football games. Traditionally, this festival was the occasion to be thankful for the harvest which had just ended. Today, I believe it’s also a time to remember all the reasons why we should be grateful."

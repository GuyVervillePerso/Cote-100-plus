        text: 'This discount chain store has enjoyed great commercial and stock market success over the past many years, religiously following the strategy that has made it famous for 35 years: to sell all its products at the single price of US$1 (C$1.25 in its Canadian stores). In 2015, Dollar Tree acquired the Family Dollar chain of stores that offered products at prices other than $1, but management never really wanted to change their strategy of selling everything at $1 for their Dollar Tree chain.'

        text: "Despite constant inflationary pressures, Dollar Tree has managed over the decades to stay true to this strategy by changing the packaging of its products, reducing costs through growing economies of scale, and improving logistics. Surprisingly, the Dollar Tree chain's gross margin has remained relatively stable over the past many years. For example, the company's gross margin was 30.5% in 2021 (January) compared to 30.9% in 2016. In the long term, however, investors suspected, and with good reason, that this single pricing strategy could eventually put the chain in trouble."

        text: 'In its defense, the company had been testing a multiple price concept in some of its stores for several months. It had also developed a new Dollar Tree Plus concept offering multi-priced items. I believe, however, that it is the combined effect of the skyrocketing costs of recent months and the sustained pressure of a major activist investor (Mantle Ridge) who got the better of what one might call the company’s single-price dogma.

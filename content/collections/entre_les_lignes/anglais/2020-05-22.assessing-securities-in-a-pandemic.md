        text: "I must admit, however, that the COVID pandemic has put a big dent in our assessment method. That said, in this context, it’s probably become even more uncertain to value the stocks of companies that we generally avoid. While our method is based on the stability of our companies' profits, COVID undermines this stability, which makes their valuation particularly difficult and uncertain."

        text: "But what about the current situation of COVID? I believe that in the vast majority of the companies we own and follow, the gap between the optimistic and the pessimistic scenario is considerably wider than under normal conditions. Thus, our forecast for a company's profits is likely to vary dramatically, depending on whether we believe in the scenario where the economy will normalize quickly or, conversely, that a second wave of contagion will strike in the coming months and delay all economic recovery."

We could, for example, use the profit made by a company in 2019 to get a better idea of the profit it could achieve again once conditions have somewhat normalized.'

        text: 'In a climate of high uncertainty, it seems to me that greater caution is required. That doesn’t mean that we have to withdraw from the stock market (alternatives to stocks are even less attractive than stocks), but that we have to remain as objective and realistic as possible in the valuation of our stocks. As they say, "it’s better to be safe than sorry".'
chapeau: 'My job is essentially to assess companies listed on the stock market. The work can seem complex; many people imagine huge mathematical models with many variables. The reality is very different and it reflects a choice we made many years ago at COTE 100: we limit ourselves as much as possible to the simplest situations that we can find. No biotech companies, whose valuations depend on the possible success of a developing drug. No securities of companies whose activities are very cyclical and whose profits can vary considerably depending on factors that are difficult to predict (oil prices, currencies, GDP growth, etc.). No start-up companies whose prospects often boil down to "make it or break it".'

        text: 'Bonds generally provide a feeling of comfort to investors. Often when the economy is down, interest rates go down and the value of bonds goes up. As of February 28, the FTSE Universal Canadian Universe Bond Index has returned 3.6% since the start of 2020.'

        text: 'But be aware that the interest rates offered by bonds are particularly low. For example, a 10-year Canadian government bond currently offers 0.953%. The same US government bond offers a 0.99% return.'

        text: 'Take the example of a 10-year Canada bond that offers you a return of 0.95% per year. If the inflation rate is indeed 2.0% on average over the next 10 years, the investor who bought the bond will become 1.05% poorer every year for 10 years. In real terms, this investor will have lost no less than 16%. And this, again assuming that this investor doesn’t pay tax.'

        text: 'There’s much debate about the valuation of stocks. Some say that the North American stock market is historically expensive. At the moment, according to Standard & Poors, the S&P 500 is trading at around 17.9 times the (adjusted) expected earnings of 2020, which is effectively above the historic average of nearly 15.0.'

        text: 'Others will also say that the forecast of adjusted profits is certainly too optimistic, in light of what we know and what we fear about coronavirus. It is totally true! In a pessimistic scenario of a recession in 2020 and a 25% drop in profits for S&P companies, the S&P 500 index would trade at almost 24.0 times the expected profits of 2020.'

        text: 'But even in such a scenario, I prefer the valuation of stocks over that of bonds. A valuation of 24.0 times earnings, even if it’s very high compared to the historic average valuation of the stock market, results in a return of almost 4.2% (the inverse of the price-earnings ratio, i.e. the earnings-to-price ratio, or 1/24.0). It’s still much more attractive than bond yields.'

        text: 'What’s more, the stock market is a mechanism for discounting the future. I believe that, even assuming the worst-case scenario for 2020, investors will soon be looking to 2021 and a likely economic recovery.'

        text: 'If, in the uncertainty surrounding the progression of the coronavirus, it’s difficult to say that the market correction represents a good opportunity to buy stocks at low prices, I believe all the same that one can say without too much risk that bonds are generally very expensive, or even that the bond market is prey to a speculative bubble. In the short term, possibly for a year or two, bonds could continue to do well. But in the long term, over 10 years for example, they seem to me like a good way to get poorer.'
chapeau: 'Many investors are happy to have bonds in their portfolios these days. And for good reason. While the stock markets are in correction mode, the value of bonds is constantly increasing in North America.'

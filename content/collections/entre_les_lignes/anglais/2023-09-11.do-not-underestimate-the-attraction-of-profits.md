        text: 'We learn several interesting and probably surprising statistics for many readers. Thus, in the article, the authors point out that, “More than $1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles, and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.”'

        text: "Many of us believe that the United States is an environmental dunce in the world. Admittedly, actions by the US federal government during Trump's presidency, including its decision to withdraw the country from the Paris climate accord in 2017, sent a negative signal. However, according to the article, “in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.”"

This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power — some $380 billion — than into drilling for oil.”'

        text: 'I wrote a blog in December 2017 titled, “A book that gives hope in the face of climate change". The book “Climate of Hope” was written by Michael Bloomberg and Carl Pope. In it they write, “The market economy can be an environmentalist’s best friend.” This, in my opinion, is what is happening in the United States and all over the world. Grants from several governments for green projects are also contributing to the phenomenon.'

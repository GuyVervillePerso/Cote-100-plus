A very pessimistic scenario could result in a continuation of the decline in the value of our securities over the next few months, but it seems to me that there is nevertheless a floor to this value.'

It seems to me that in such cases it would be difficult, if not impossible, to estimate a bottom value.

These companies find themselves in a situation where access to equity capital is suddenly very limited and new debt suddenly costs much more than in the past. For example, according to the Federal Bank of St. Louis (St. Louis Fed), the spread between rates on junk bonds and US government rates had climbed to 4.71% on May 16, 2022, compared to just 3.27% on April 5 and 3.03% on December 29, 2021.'

        text: 'Here I will use analogy (another one) from the world of tennis. A player who has reached the top echelons of the world rankings cannot afford to take his foot off the gas and ride on his recent successes. The world of tennis is highly competitive, and a few weeks of relaxation will often result in a gradual, then sudden, slide in the rankings. In tennis, as in business, you cannot hope to stand still. You must constantly seek to improve and develop.'

In everything we do, we seek to make decisions that will first benefit our investors, but which will also benefit our company and the community as a whole. When thinking about developing any new service, we first ask ourselves this question: “Would we ourselves be interested in investing in such a product?”"

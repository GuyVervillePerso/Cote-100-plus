        text: "At that time, Visa's stock was worth about $18 (all data that follows is adjusted for a subsequent 4-to-1 split) and was valued at nearly 15 times expected earnings. This was a relatively low valuation ratio compared to its historical valuation due to concerns that the US government could regulate debit transactions and thereby materially reduce the profitability of such transactions for Visa (and Mastercard)."

        text: 'I believe it is the job of any investor to try to find these advantages. To do this, one must look for companies that have the potential to significantly increase their profits over the next 5 or 10 years. I personally believe that you increase your chances of finding such companies by focusing on those that have already proven themselves and are already profitable and growing. We should also try to identify companies that have developed a long-term sustainable business model that is protected from competitors by high barriers to entry.'

        text: "Once such companies are identified, an investor should attempt to purchase their security at a reasonable valuation level. Ideally, one should see the potential for the price-earnings ratio to increase over the years, as had been the case with Visa's stock. By paying reasonable valuation ratios, the investor not only increases the long-term return potential, but also substantially reduces the downside risk in the event that one was mistaken about the company's earnings growth prospects."

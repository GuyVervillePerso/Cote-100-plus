        text: 'One of these heuristics is our tendency to categorize, to place various phenomena in two opposing camps. In many areas, we tend to say that a situation is white or black. A person is either conservative or progressive, Democrat or Republican, rich or poor, healthy or sick, reasonable or unreasonable, etc. Rarely will we call things or people a shade of gray when, in reality, it’s the colour that qualifies the vast majority of phenomena.'

        text: 'In investing, the preferred labels are “value” or “growth”. The majority of investors fall into one of these two camps; others are somewhere in between, such as those who adopt the GARP or “Growth At a Reasonable Price” philosophy. The “value” investor looks for inexpensive stocks of companies that are not really growing, but whose asset values would be undervalued by the stock markets. The “growth” investor invests in high growth companies and will generally be willing to pay a high price for such growth, the idea being that the strong growth of the company makes the current value of the security less significant.'

        text: "However, I think such a categorization is too simplistic. I believe current practice would label COTE 100's investment philosophy as that of a “value” investor because we seek to invest in stocks of companies that we believe are undervalued relative to the fundamental market evaluation that we make of it. But is this label accurate?"

        text: 'For me, the growth of a business, historical and future, is an integral part of how you assess it. The stock of the company that has no growth potential will be worth much less than that of the company that shows strong growth. For example, I fully understand that the stock of Visa, which has shown robust organic growth for many years and whose growth prospects still appear to be very strong, deserve significantly higher valuation ratios than the stock of a company like Metro that is growing much more modestly. However, these are two stocks that we hold in our portfolios.'

        text: "But there are two big problems with this statement. On the one hand, companies that manage to grow quickly are usually valued very dearly on the stock market. For example, Amazon's stock, possibly the flagship of the “growth” investment camp, is currently trading at over 66.0 times forecasted earnings for 2021. The other big problem is that it is very difficult to identify the companies that will continue to grow rapidly for the next several years. We live in a capitalist world where competition is fierce and technological changes are very rapid. This is why forecasts of strong future growth are generally very uncertain. In my opinion, it is rather dangerous to promote growth without too much regard to the valuation of a security."

        text: 'I find that the label managers and investors give themselves – a “value” investor as opposed to a “growth” investor – can lead to mistakes. For example, it seems to me that, at the moment, most of the opportunities to buy stocks at a good price are found among stocks of more traditional companies and which could be labeled by many as “value” stocks. As a result, the one who made his bed in the “growth” camp could very well miss interesting opportunities. At the same time, I believe that the “value” investor should constantly seek opportunities in the stocks of growth companies.'

chapeau: 'We all seek to simplify our decision making. In psychology, we call "heuristics" the stuff that we develop to speed up our decisions. Generally, these heuristics serve us well. Would you really want to take all the time in the world to choose what clothes you will wear today? Or to choose the type of cereal you will buy for your children? 95% of the time, the heuristics we have developed save us time and energy, without causing major problems.'

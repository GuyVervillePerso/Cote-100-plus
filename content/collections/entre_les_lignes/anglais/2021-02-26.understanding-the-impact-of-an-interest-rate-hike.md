        text: 'On that note, I thought I would talk about the importance of long-term interest rates in valuing stocks. For, it bears repeating, the valuation of any financial asset, from works of art to bonds to real estate, depends on the general level of interest rates. The higher the interest rates, the lower the value of assets and vice versa.'

        text: 'This example demonstrates the greater impact a fluctuation in interest rates has on longer-term assets. This is why the value of a 30-year bond fluctuates much more than that of a five-year bond. This is also the reason why the securities of publicly traded companies, which are also long-term assets, can be significantly affected by increases and decreases in rates.'

        text: 'Regarding securities, I would argue that high growth companies, as well as those that offer hope of future profits but are not yet profitable, will be even more affected by a rise in interest rates than mature companies whose growth is not very fast but are already very profitable. In the first case, the profits are relatively much more distant in time than in the second case.'

        text: 'In my opinion, this is one of the reasons that would explain the fact that it was the unprofitable, start-up or high-growth companies that performed best on the stock market in recent months: interest rates had fallen significantly at the start of the pandemic and in the months following the first wave. In theory, the recent rate hike should have a similar opposite effect. I think this is a warning to investors who own start-up stocks or stocks that are not yet profitable.'
chapeau: 'In recent weeks, interest rates have jumped sharply upward. For example, in Canada, the 10-year government bond rate is currently 1.47%. You will tell me that it is still very low. But everything is relative in this world and the recent rate is more than twice that of last January (0.68%). In the United States, it is much the same phenomenon: the 10-year government bond rate is close to 1.55% compared to 0.92% at the beginning of January and 0.64% at the beginning of last September.'

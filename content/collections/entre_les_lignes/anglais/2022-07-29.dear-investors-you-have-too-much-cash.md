However, this inverse relationship between the level of cash in one’s portfolio and the level of stock markets is not new. To prove the point, I pulled out the level of US individual investor cash since December 1987 (in green). I also overlayed the performance of the S&P 500 over the same period (in red). The result is fascinating!'

        text: 'First, the average individual investor has too much cash on hand all the time. Between 1987 and 2022, the lowest level of cash on record was 11%, in March 1998. Over this period of approximately 35 years, the average level of cash was 22% of an investor’s portfolio. Even if cash can provide a slight return, it certainly does not approach the stock market return of 10.5% compounded annually achieved during this period. Too much cash, for several years, limits long-term returns.'

        text: 'The second point is that do-it-yourself investors don’t deploy their cash when opportunities arise. In September 2002, retail investor cash was 38.6%. This period corresponds to the bottom of the stock market following the bursting of the technology bubble. In March 2009, these same investors had 44.8% of their portfolios in cash, which corresponds precisely to the trough of the financial crisis of 2008-09.'

        text: 'When the markets correct, I have the impression that investors wait before deploying their cash because they hope to buy at the bottom of the market. Unfortunately, this is an almost impossible thing to do. Waiting for the bottom, they miss the dip and miss out on the bounce, leaving a lot of money on the table. If you’re a long-term investor, it’s okay to be fully invested before the market bottoms out.'

At the moment, for example, it is impossible to know whether the markets will continue to fall. However, I am convinced that the recent decline very likely offers you some opportunities to deploy at least some of your cash.'

  There is a piece of information that I look at frequently and that always manages to amaze me. This is the average level of cash held in the portfolio of individual investors. Specifically, I consult the data published monthly by the Association of American Individual Investors (AAII).

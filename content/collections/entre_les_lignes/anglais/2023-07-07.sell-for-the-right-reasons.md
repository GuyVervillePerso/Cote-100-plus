        text: 'Please note that I am not saying that buying a stock is a simple process. On the contrary, the purchase of a stock requires long analyses. However, after going through an exhaustive process, it is generally quite easy to decide whether the stock is a buy or not. For example, imagine that you are analyzing a quality company, with interesting growth prospects, with limited risks and offered at an attractive price. If this stock is more attractive than the worst company in your portfolio, the decision to buy becomes obvious. The problem is that these companies are rare, and it takes a lot of work to find them. This scarcity is the main reason why we trade infrequently in our portfolios.'

        text: 'The decision to sell is usually much more difficult. In my view, the reasons for selling a stock can be divided into two categories: valuation and fundamentals. Often, the decision to sell or hold can be different if only one of these categories is used. Let’s examine them.'

In his recent book Avantage Bourse, Philippe Le Blanc revisits some of these decisions. I decided to do the exercise again, but from a different angle. Here is my observation.'

Here is a recap of the seven sales where I present the compound annual return of the stock from the date of the sale until today.'

        text: "Stock\_3 is McDonald’s (“MCD”). It was bought in 2011 when it was trading at nearly 15.0 times expected earnings, a valuation ratio we thought was attractive. By January 2016, the stock had soared and was now at almost 22.0 times expected earnings. This valuation, which at the time seemed high to us, had been a significant factor in our decision to sell. Although we managed to make a respectable 43% gain over this period, we have to admit that it would have been better to keep the stock."

        text: 'In closing, this methodology should not necessarily be applied with absolute rigidity. Stock market investing is more of an art than a science where every situation is different. Selling based on a valuation can make sense in certain situations, such as excessive overvaluation. That said, a stock investor should remain cautious about using valuation as the primary reason for a sale.'

  In your opinion, is it easier to buy or sell a stock? For me, the answer is clear: selling a stock is much more difficult.

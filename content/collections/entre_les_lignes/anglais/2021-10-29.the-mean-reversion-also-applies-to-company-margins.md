        text: "Every quarter, I ask myself “why must all companies (or almost) publish their results at the same time? Couldn't they manage to space everything out within the quarter?” On the other hand, this concentration of results in a short period of time allows our investment team to more easily compare the results of our companies with each other and, perhaps more importantly, to identify global trends that affect all companies."

Observation of the results of this company (which I will not name) confirmed a trend established a few months ago and which was particularly strong during the last quarter: generalized inflation I would qualify as “galloping”.'

Here is an example of the evolution of the weekly rental cost of a 40-foot container carrying merchandise between Asia and North America (sources: ICIS.com and fbx.freightos.com):'

        text: "For a manufacturing company, the rising costs don't stop there. We must also consider the marked increase in the costs of basic materials. For example, the costs of chemical resins derived from petroleum and used in the manufacture of plastic products have exploded with the rising cost of petroleum. Most base metals have also seen their prices rise. The CRB index brings together all the basic foodstuffs (“commodities”) around the world and its price has literally exploded since the start of the pandemic:"

        text: "Thus, I see that the operating margin (EBITDA) of the company in question reached what was probably a historic low of 15.6% in the quarter ended September 30. This compares to 23.3% a year earlier. Over the past three years, the company has recorded an average operating margin of 22.4%. The company's profitability is therefore far from its historical average."

It's hard to say, but the term “galloping” used above leads me to believe that it is not easy to keep inflation under control when it starts to run wild – just as it is not easy to control a galloping stallion!"

        text: 'At the same time, in my opinion, it would be a mistake to extrapolate the recent cost increases facing businesses. The current supply chain bottlenecks will be resolved sooner or later. In addition, companies will gradually find ways to adjust, for example by changing their packaging or finding alternative and less expensive materials. However, these solutions will take time. Many will also try to reduce their transportation costs by changing their sources of supply.'

        text: "In the short term, however, the easiest and most effective way to counter cost increases is to increase the prices of your products or services. This is precisely what the manufacturing company that I analyzed has been doing over the past few months and will continue to do in the months to come. These price increases should gradually bring the company's EBITDA margin closer to its historical average, in my opinion. But your portfolio companies still need to be able to increase their prices, which is certainly not always the case."

chapeau: 'We are entering the big period of quarterly results this week, which will last until mid-November (for the quarter ended September 30). This week for example, seven of our companies published their results (note that we have a grand total of 48 in all our portfolios under management). Next week it will be no less than 14 other companies in the portfolio – 29 % of our companies. You know what my team and I will be doing next week!'

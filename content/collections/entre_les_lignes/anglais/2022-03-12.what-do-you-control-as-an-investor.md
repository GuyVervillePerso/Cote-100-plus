        text: 'I am thinking, among other things, of what will happen in Ukraine and Russia. Will the conflict escalate or are we close to a resolution between the two countries? What will be the economic impact of the conflict? We saw the major impact it has had on the prices of many commodities, starting with oil, but also on the prices of several metals and on cereals. This is without considering the problems caused by the conflict for transport and logistics in Europe. The situation is likely to exacerbate the already high inflation in the coming months.'

Or on the contrary, will Canada and the United States choose to invest more in their oil production to free themselves even more from their reliance on other countries and to help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian gas and oil?'

        text: 'The investor controls what he invests in and how his portfolio is constructed.

        text: 'For our part, we regularly assess each of the securities we hold in our portfolio as objectively as possible. Does the situation in Europe have an impact on some of these stocks? Do our companies make significant revenues in Ukraine or Russia? Are our companies able to counter inflation by raising their prices? Are some of our companies too indebted and could they experience financial difficulties in the event of a prolonged war? Does war increase the risks for some of our businesses? Are any of our companies overpriced relative to our ratings? Have others become attractive buys with the recent market slump?'

        text: "In tennis, you can't control the elements like the wind, the sun, or the heat. We can't do much to control our opponent either. The only thing we can do is to focus on our game, the strategy we adopt, and adjust according to the situation. It's the same with investing."
chapeau: 'The Russian-Ukrainian war is causing enormous uncertainty for investors. It has also produced a lot of volatility and dragged stock markets lower in recent weeks, adding to the correction that had already been caused by the upcoming rise in interest rates.'

        text: 'Company ABC achieves a return on its capital of 5% while company XYZ achieves a return of 17%. After one year, company ABC will have generated $5 million in profits compared to $17 million for company XYZ. If these two companies reinvest all their profits back into their business and continue to achieve a similar return on capital over the long term, company ABC will make $12.6 million in profit in 20 years compared to $336 million in profits for XYZ.'

You will still have made a return of 12.1% annually. In other words, an investment of $10,000 would return $98,200 in 20 years.'

        text: 'However, an investor should spend most of his time analyzing the competition, growth potential, barriers to entry, technological changes, industry developments, regulations, management competence and its capital allocation. These facets of a business are some of the factors that will determine the ability of the company to achieve high returns on its capital over a long period of time. It is easy to identify companies that are achieving a high return on capital today. However, it is very difficult to identify which ones will be able to maintain high performance for many years. Few companies succeed in reinvesting their profits at a high rate repeatedly for several years.'

        text: "In summary, it is much more profitable for an investor to identify companies that can achieve and maintain a high return on capital than to accurately determine the intrinsic value of a company. So, an investor shouldn't worry too much about paying 30 times or 35 times the profits for a company they consider exceptional. If he's going for the long haul and he's done his homework properly, he has a sufficiently large margin of safety. It is better to buy a great company at an ordinary price than an ordinary company at a great price."

  Since the low on March 23, 2020, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 99.5 %. Some investors will say that the stock markets are overvalued, and now it is difficult to find deals. I believe these investors should spend more time researching quality companies rather than looking for companies at a discount. Here is an example that illustrates this point.

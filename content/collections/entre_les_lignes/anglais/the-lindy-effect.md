title: 'The Lindy Effect'
chapeau: "The Lindy Effect was developed by Albert Harry Goldmann in the 1960s and later popularized by Nassim Taleb in his book\__Antifragile_. This theory posits that the life expectancy of certain non-perishable things, such as a technology or an idea, is proportional to their age. In other words, the longer something has existed, the more likely it is to continue existing."

        text: 'Nike experienced significant difficulties in the late 1990s, primarily due to the controversial working conditions of its employees abroad. During this period, Adidas and Under Armour became increasingly competitive. Then, in 2006, Nike underwent a transformation led by Mark Parker, where innovation and better social practices enabled its brand to make a strong comeback. This example somewhat confirms the Lindy Effect. Having survived downturns and multiple economic and political contexts, its probability of survival increases with each passing year.'

        text: " Incidentally, I've heard this comment at least twice in the past few weeks applying to the Florida East Coast real estate market. According to two different commentators, the demand for properties near the sea will always be very strong, which means that the prices of properties along the coast cannot fall. To be frank, they both were probably looking at a long-term horizon. Their true statement should have been: "

        text: 'Maybe they are right. I agree that the Florida real estate market, particularly seaside, will be in high demand for many years to come. There is still a high proportion of the population reaching retirement age, both in Canada and in the rest of the United States and Europe, who will want to take it easy under the Florida sun during their retirement. It is also normal that properties in Florida in general are worth more than comparable properties in other less attractive regions for a retired population from Ohio, Ontario, or Indiana.'

        text: 'On the one hand, for a few years, interest rates have been and are still very low. For example, I see that an American buyer could currently finance the purchase of a property with a 10-year mortgage at a rate of less than 2.40%. However, the American Federal Reserve as well as the Bank of Canada have warned that they will significantly increase their key rates over the coming months and probably into 2023. Also, the inflation rate has been particularly high for several months and it could remain high, which could lead to even higher rate increases than currently contemplated.'

        text: "Another consideration is that an investor should consider the alternatives available before investing in a Florida property at an inflated price. In investing, it's all about opportunity costs – what potential returns from other investment options are you missing out on by investing in a Florida property? The sentiment that Florida real estate prices cannot fall in the long term may be valid. But is it the best investment alternative for a long-term investor?"

chapeau: "It is well known, one of the most dangerous phrases for the investor is “This time it's different”. It can be very expensive to believe that the future will be completely different from the past and to extrapolate recent trends."

        text: ' closed at - $37.43, on Monday, April 20. In other words, buyers of the futures contract were paid $37.43 for taking possession of a barrel of oil in May at the Cushing, Oklahoma terminal. However, it’s precisely this specificity which explains the negative price of the futures contract. Indeed, most investors who buy oil futures don’t intend to take physical possession of the oil, but rather to gain from the fluctuation in the price of the commodity. Monday therefore resulted in a mad rush from investors to sell their futures expiring on Tuesday as the capacity to store oil in Oklahoma is rapidly diminishing.'

This fund has gained popularity in recent weeks with many investors wanting to bet on an oil price rebound after its recent fall. The good news for investors is that the exchange-traded fund had already sold its futures contracts that expire in May in early April to buy those that expire in June. However, this turnover usually results in a loss for the investor because the market is generally in a postponement situation ("contango"), that is to say that the June contract is worth more than the contract of the month of May. At the time of writing, the contract that expires in June is trading at $14.06 while the contract that expires in July is trading at $21.00. Thus, the sale of the June contracts and the purchase of the July contracts would result in a loss of approximately $7 per contract over a month should the price of a barrel of oil remain stable at approximately $14.00. The current extreme situation is due to the large imbalance between supply and demand in the short term, but it also testifies to the difficulty of taking advantage of the anticipated rebound in oil prices.'

chapeau: 'This morning, my colleague and partner, Marc L’Écuyer, portfolio manager at COTE 100, wrote the following regarding a situation that I consider worrying for many investors. If I’m using his insight, it’s that I’m not comfortable writing on subjects that I don’t master well; this is definitely the case with oil futures. The situation reminded me of a popular saying: "Stick to your knitting". Apart from its literal sense, it means that we should stick to activities that we understand well and in which we have acquired expertise and experience. Clearly, many individual investors believe they can make quick money by speculating on oil. Marc and I believe it’s a losing proposition.'

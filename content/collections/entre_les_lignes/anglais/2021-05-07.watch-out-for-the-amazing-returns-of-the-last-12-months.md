        text: 'However, care must be taken with such returns. Remember that a year ago, the markets corrected sharply and reached a low during March 23, 2020. On that day, the flagship North American stock index, the S&P 500, was bottoming out, down some 36.0% from its all-time high on February 20. From that low on March 23, the index has rebounded 93.5%, including dividends.'

        text: 'The same is true for many companies whose profits were severely battered during the period of severe health restrictions last spring. Many companies are indeed posting extraordinary profit increases in their first quarter of 2021, but they are comparing to depressed numbers a year ago.'

        text: 'Take the example of Starbucks, a company that we have owned for several years. During the quarter ended March 31, and compared to the same quarter of 2020, the company posted a 15% same-store sales increase (including a 91% increase in China), an increase in total revenues of 11.2% and growth in adjusted net profits of 91.3%.'

        text: 'We must obviously take these growth figures with a big grain of salt and especially not extrapolate them. In most cases, it was not recent corporate earnings that were excellent, but those of the past year which were abnormally low. A good way to get a better idea would be to compare recent corporate earnings to comparable periods two years ago, before the impact of the pandemic. Thus, we see that earnings per share for Starbucksâ€™ most recent quarter are showing a more normal increase of 3.3% compared to the same quarter two years ago.'

        text: "In order to take into account the exceptional period of the pandemic and in particular the months when the world economy was literally brought to a halt, I suggest that you compare the current results of your companies with those of two years ago. As for the returns on an investment portfolio (yours or a manager's), don't rely on returns over one year, but over a period of at least five years."
chapeau: "The past 12 month returns for many funds and portfolio managers are nothing short of amazing. Who wouldn't be attracted to a return of more than 100% over twelve months? It seems to me that some managers take advantage of this to attract new potential investors with such figures."

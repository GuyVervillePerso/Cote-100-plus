        text: 'One of the basic concepts that we’re taught in finance school is that the return potential generally goes with the level of risk that one’s willing to take. If you’re not ready to take risks, you’ll have to live with anemic returns. A 10-year Canadian government bond currently offers 0.71% annual interest. Buy such a bond and you are almost certain (in theory, the Canadian government could still go bankrupt) to earn 0.71% per year in interest, in addition to recovering your initial investment. For someone looking to sleep well, this is a risk-free investment.'

        text: 'But the stock market investor will inevitably go through periods of great uncertainty. This is the price to pay for high long-term returns. Personally, I’ve been investing in the stock market since 1992 and have survived several stock market corrections and a few bear markets. I remember the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Then in 2000, the tech bubble started to burst. How can we forget the terrible terrorist attacks of September 11? And of course, the financial crisis of 2008-2009. I have long believed that we wouldn’t see such a crisis again for at least a generation. However, we can now wonder whether the crisis of the new coronavirus will rival it. At the very least, I think you could say that it’s been more traumatic for many people because it’s touched us all in our daily lives.'

        text: 'In each of these stressful episodes, many investors jumped ship by selling their shares and saying "I won''t be caught again." This is still the case this time. Many investors have likely tossed in the towel, and many more will likely do so in the coming weeks.'

        text: 'And yet, what do you think has been the annual compound return of the S&P 500 since 1992, a period of more than 29 years? 8.5% including dividends. A person who invested $100,000 in this index on January 1, 1992, who kept the investment for the next 29.25 years or so, and who systematically reinvested the dividends would end up today with an investment worth nearly $1.1 million, almost 11.0 times the initial stake. I emphasize that this calculation takes into account the recent correction of more than 20% of this index.'

If investing in the stock market and making money there was easy, all investors would be millionaires. The road to long-term market success is far from easy. It’s littered with pitfalls and periods of great uncertainty. This is what makes the stock market so exciting. And that’s also why it has been so rewarding for those who’ve stayed on board amidst the worst storms.'

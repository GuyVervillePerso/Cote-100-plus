        text: 'Personally, I have always found that finance schools do not necessarily help future investors think long-term. There are a host of funds and stock market simulations that allow them to familiarize themselves with the world of stock market investing. The problem is that most are short term focused! How else can you do it when a finance course only lasts one school session? How do you ask students to invest for the long term when they are evaluated on the performance of their portfolio over three or six months? Such exercises are certainly interesting from a didactic point of view, but they probably do not develop the “long-term” thinking of students.'

        text: 'As the managers of Markel did with two American universities, why not set up an investment fund truly focused on the long term? In such a fund, students from Laval University would propose, with supporting analysis, a maximum of 20 North American securities which would be kept, without transactions, for twenty years. The winning team would be identified by a selection committee and would receive a $5,000 scholarship. The remainder ($20,000) would be invested in a maximum of 20 stocks for the next 20 years... with no transactions after the portfolio is constructed.'

Starting in the 2024-2025 school year, the goal is to incorporate the project into an investment course in the baccalaureate in finance.'

        text: 'The phenomenon of meme stocks raged in 2021. We tend to want to forget this period of confinement linked to COVID-19. At that time, many people working at home had become stock speculators, “day traders”. Combine the craze for stock speculation with the popularity of social networks, particularly the Reddit platform, and you have the potential to explode stocks on the stock market.'

In each case, we are talking about practically moribund companies whose prospects are bleak and which were largely sold short.'

The next day, the stock saw a maximum increase of 113% to its high of the day ($64.83). For its part, AMC shares appreciated by 78% during the day of May 13, and reached a maximum increase of 129% on May 14. Apparently, this frenzy was started by a few messages published on X by Mr.\_Keith Gill, the one who brought the world’s attention to GameStop in 2021."

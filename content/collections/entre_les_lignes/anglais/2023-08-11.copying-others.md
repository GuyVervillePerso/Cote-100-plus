This is usually the case when a company announces a major acquisition. The story involving Fiserv (FI), Fidelity National Services (FIS) and Global Payments (GPN), three companies operating in the payments industry, is clear.'

This major acquisition of US$39\_billion allowed it to extend its service offering in a whole new segment, that of payment acceptance. Fiserv thus became a major global player offering solutions in several areas of the payment industry."

This story makes me feel like Fidelity National and Global Payments literally imitated Fiserv. They bought the “same thing”, practically at the same time.'

        text: 'We can certainly explain this behaviour by the desire to remain competitive. However, I wonder about the merits of these acquisitions. Were they rational? Were they made with a sense of urgency? Was the price paid fair? According to my analysis, Fiserv paid nearly 12.0 times operating profit while Fidelity National and Global Payments paid nearly 50% more, or multiples of 19.0 times and 17.0 respectively.'

        text: 'In my opinion, the leaders of Fidelity National and Global Payments have been under immense pressure – “institutional” pressure. Imagine that you are the leader of Fidelity National or Global Payments and you choose not to follow Fiserv. You will find yourself in a very bad position if the Fiserv’s acquisition becomes a runaway success. Come to think of it, who can blame executives for making a mega acquisition if everyone else is making one? That’s a great way to keep your job, isn’t it?'

        text: "In retrospect, the decision to copy Fiserv was not a success. Fidelity National recently announced that it had sold half of Worldpay, admitting that this acquisition had been a failure. In 2019, it paid nearly US$43.0\_billion, while the recent sale now pegs its value at nearly US$18.5\_billion, a loss of just over 50%. Unsurprisingly, Fidelity National’s financial and stock market performance was disappointing. The day before the announcement of the acquisition, the stock was trading at $109; four years later, it is trading at $58."

  Like many children, my twins have this nasty habit of always wanting to copy each other. If one takes a red crayon, the other will definitely want a red crayon. If one decides to play baseball, the other will want to play baseball. Even if it is not always easy to manage these interactions, I reassure myself by telling myself that this process of imitation is normal and that it will fade over time.

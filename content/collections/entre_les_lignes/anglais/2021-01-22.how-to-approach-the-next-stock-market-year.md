        text: 'Among other positive factors, interest rates remain historically very low, which has not only contributed to a less severe economic slowdown than one might have expected at the start of the pandemic, but is also expected to contribute to a strong recovery. Also, Western governments have clearly shown that they are ready to do anything to revive the economy by injecting gigantic sums of money into their economy to help the smallest businesses and the poorest of their population to better weather the crisis. In addition, the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will not hike rates until the job market has fully recovered from the pandemic, which could take several quarters. Such rates are particularly favourable for the valuation of any financial asset, starting with the stock market.'

        text: 'It seems to me that there are several dark clouds covering a growing part of our stock market’s blue sky. Of these, I would first note the meteoric rise in speculative activity on the part of investors. We see this in the record number of day-trading accounts that have been opened by individuals since March 2020. We see it in the record number of initial public offerings in North America and in particular in the disconcerting appeal of the “SPAC” (“Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation”), those shell companies to which investors write blank checks to make an acquisition. We can also see it in the enthusiasm for technology companies which had another exceptional year on the stock market, after several years of superior returns.'

        text: 'The long-term investor should not be overly concerned about the current situation. On the other hand, I think one should make sure to avoid securities that are very popular and whose valuations defy reason. Rather, he should ensure that his businesses remain reasonably valued, in good financial health, and that his portfolio is still well diversified.'

        text: 'It’s impossible to predict when a segment of the market that is fashionable will lose its appeal to other investors. It’s quite possible that the tech stocks craze will continue into 2021 and continue to propel stock indexes higher. However, I believe it is only a matter of time before these stocks, whose valuations seem excessive to me, deflate. Meanwhile, a little bit of cash on the sidelines also seems like a good idea to be able to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise.'

        text: 'When market excesses subside, the prudent investor should not be unduly affected and should even be able to benefit from the pendulum swinging back towards "value" stocks. In the meantime, patience and caution should be the order of the day.'
chapeau: "I am optimistic by nature, but cautious. So let's start with the many reasons that allow us to be optimistic at the start of 2021. First of all, after the year 2020 which could hardly have been more difficult for the world population, it’s a safe bet that the conditions of the global pandemic will subside during the year. With the resolution of COVID-19, expect the economy to rebound strongly and the job market to gradually recover. The pandemic has certainly repressed a strong demand which could explode as soon as sanitary conditions become safe. Restaurants, airline companies, hotels, museums will undoubtedly do a roaring business."

        text: "As you know, Metro is one of the leading grocery chains in Canada. In my opinion, it’s probably the best managed company in the industry in Canada, possibly in North America. During the crisis, Metro sales exploded upward. In its most recent quarter, which ended on March 14 (so with almost two weeks of the quarter affected by the pandemic), Metro's comparable store sales increased by 9.7%. In addition, during the conference call that followed the publication of these results, management indicated that same-store sales increased 25% in the month following the end of the most recent quarter. Despite higher spending due to government-mandated health standards, earnings per share were $0.69 in the quarter, up 20.4% from a year earlier. In the press release announcing these results, Mr. Eric La Flèche, President and Chief Executive Officer of Metro, wrote: "

        text: "Since the beginning of 2020, Metro's stock is up 5.5% compared to a drop of 10.4% for the Canadian index. You’ll also notice that the stock did particularly well when the Canadian index fell the most, at the start of the pandemic. On March 23, when the Canadian index lost some 30% of its value, Metro stock fell only 3.3% since the beginning of 2020. You’ll also see that the Metro stock did much worse from the moment the stock market started to rebound from its lows."

        text: 'Dollar General, an American company with a market capitalization of nearly US$46 billion, is a chain of over 16,000 stores in the United States. Like Dollarama, Dollar General stores offer low-priced merchandise, but the difference is that its offering is largely geared toward food. In addition, Dollar General stores are generally located in less affluent neighborhoods or in rural areas.'

The company's same-store sales for the period jumped an impressive 21.7% from a year earlier, and earnings per share increased 73.0%. Commenting on these results, the president of the company said, "

        text: "In my opinion, when building a well-diversified portfolio, an investor should seek to have a good proportion in defensive securities. However, it shouldn't hold just those kinds of securities as they tend to do much worse when the economy is doing well and the stock markets are going up. This is the secret to healthy diversification."
chapeau: 'We’re going through an unprecedented health crisis which has resulted in an exceptional economic crisis. We’ve never seen the unemployment rate explode as seen in recent weeks. Not even during the Great Depression of the 1930s.'

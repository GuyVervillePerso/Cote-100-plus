        text: 'The United States is ultrarich and powerful. However, it’s not any better equipped than most other countries in the world to deal with the ravages of the pandemic. It won’t be able to get rid of it, by force nor by fury. The only solution is to wait quietly at home. Wait until a vaccine is discovered, developed and produced, a process that experts say could take between 12 and 18 months.'

        text: 'In fact, I’ve learned that many investors have opened brokerage accounts with discount brokers in recent weeks. Obviously, many people want to take advantage of the sharp drop in the markets. I also heard that many of these "investors" had opened margin accounts. I guess it’s with the idea of borrowing to invest. To date, those who have benefited from the sharp drop in the markets during the month of March have been rewarded with a huge rebound in the stock markets. At the time of writing, the US S&P 500 is down 11.8% from the start of the year (in US $ and excluding dividends); it was down about 32% during the day of March 23.'

        text: 'The current crisis is the ultimate test of our individual and collective resilience. It appeals to our patience, to our confidence that things will eventually return to a semblance of normalcy. But as for the athlete who wants to become a high-level tennis player, he/she must be ready to invest energy and time, a lot of time.'
chapeau: "Some things take time in life; it can’t be helped. We cannot, for example, force the arrival of good weather in Quebec. You also can't get a coronavirus vaccine in three months. Nor to force a recovery of our economy without possibly paying the heavy price of a second wave of the pandemic. You cannot become a good tennis player in a few days, even if you play 12 hours a day with the best coach in the world."

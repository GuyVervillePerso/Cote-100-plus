        text: 'In the case of Copart, its balance sheet in its latest quarter, ended April 30, showed cash of just over $2.1 billion and debt of only $22.4 million, for net cash of nearly $2.1 billion. In the income statement for the quarter, the item “net interest income” (expense) went from ($4.5 million) to $17.9 million. On a per-share basis, I estimate this turnaround contributed nearly 28% of the earnings-per-share growth of 20.7% in the quarter versus a year earlier.'

        text: 'As for Enghouse, in its latest quarter ended January 31, 2023, the company had cash of $250.7 million with no debt. In the quarter, its interest income reached $976,000 compared to $129,000 in the same quarter last year. If the rates offered on cash remain stable, there is reason to believe that this revenue could continue to increase in the coming quarters.'

        text: 'Today, companies that have been cautious and patient over the past few years, such as Copart, Berkshire Hathaway and Enghouse, are in my view in a position of strength: they have a lot of capital. Until these companies invest this capital, they will continue to be rewarded with much more attractive interest income on their cash than in the past.'
chapeau: 'I noticed something in the recent results of a few of our portfolio companies: the interest income of companies with a lot of cash has literally exploded.'

        text: "Mr. Shultz is a major shareholder of Starbucks, a stock we own in some of our portfolios under management. The last time he declared his shareholding of the company, in June 2020, he owned 34.7 million (directly and indirectly), which represents 3.0% of the shares of the company and a value of almost $2.9 billion at the stock's recent price. Clearly, Mr. Shultz has a vested interest in seeing the company and its stock continue to grow over the long term."

        text: 'It is quite typical: an owner thinks differently than a simple manager. In addition to the fact that he founded the company 50 years ago, owning some 34.7 million shares, in my opinion, encourages Mr. Shultz to make the necessary decisions for the long-term benefit of the company.'

        text: "Most of the time, such decisions are costly in the short term. For example, the decision to invest more in R&D reduces a company's profits in the short term, but it could significantly increase its growth and profitability in the longer term."

        text: 'I also have in mind the example of Amerco, which we have held in some of our portfolios for many years and whose business is better known by its main division, U-Haul. Mr. Edward Shoen, company president, owns nearly 8.4 million shares, or 42.7% of the total, which are worth more than $4.6 billion. However, Mr. Shoen made the decision several years ago to invest heavily in a new service for his customers, self-storage services for individuals, a decision that weighed on the company’s profitability for several years, before starting to contribute significantly to its growth over the past two years.'

        text: "The decision to halt share buybacks and invest more in its stores could have the same impacts for Starbucks. It's always hard to predict things like this, but I think you can be sure that a leader like Mr. Shultz, who has a proven track record and a strong motivation to create shareholder value, will make the decisions that he believes will be the most beneficial to shareholders in the long term."
chapeau: "On April 4, Mr. Howard Shultz took over the presidency of Starbucks, the company he founded in 1972. One of his first initiatives as interim president was to cancel the company's share buyback program. The previous management had announced last October its intention to pay out US$20 billion (all the following figures are in US dollars) of capital over the next three years to the shareholders of the company in the form of dividends (for almost a third) and share buybacks (nearly two-thirds)."

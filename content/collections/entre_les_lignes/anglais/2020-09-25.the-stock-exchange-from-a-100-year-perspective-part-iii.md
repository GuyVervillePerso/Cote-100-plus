This is a bit to be expected when you know that this is the biggest stock market on the planet. The markets of other countries were significantly more concentrated, including the United Kingdom where Vodaphone shares accounted for 9% of its stock market. And what about Finland where Nokia monopolized 70% of its stock market! It’s not easy to obtain adequate diversification in such markets for an index investor.'

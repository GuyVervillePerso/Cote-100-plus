        text: 'I discuss the concept of “magnitude of rectitude” in my book Avantage Bourse. The example I use is that of the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin, which is based on a real portfolio that has existed since 1988. In 2013, we published a report for subscribers entitled, “25 years already”. In it, we carried out a complete review of the first 25 years of this real portfolio, its good moves, and its not so-good moves. In particular, we listed all the buy recommendations that we made to subscribers in the approximately 300 monthly issues of the Bulletin.'

        text: 'Although this example is somewhat dated, its conclusions are, in my opinion, still valid. Over 25 years, on average, out of all the stocks recommended and purchased, about 30% have given us excellent returns, including a few big winners, 20% have been big losers that caused us to lose a lot of money, 25% were stocks that gave us modest gains and 25% were simply a waste of time.'

        text: 'On the other hand, when you are convinced that a stock is an exceptional buying opportunity that meets all your selection criteria, buy a good amount. It takes as much work to analyze a security that will occupy 0.5% of your portfolio as a security that will weigh 5% of the same portfolio. However, if you are right, the stock that represents 5% of your portfolio at the start could make you considerably richer than the one that was worth only 0.5%.'

On this subject, I just finished reading the book\_"

        text: ', by Hannah Ritchie (which I rated ★★★★★). According to the author, the actions of a consumer that would have the most positive impact on our planet would be, among others, the purchase of an electric car (or, even better, travelling by bike or walking) and a significant reduction of his beef consumption. There are many other actions we can take that are good for the environment, but she believes these two actions will provide the greatest benefits.'

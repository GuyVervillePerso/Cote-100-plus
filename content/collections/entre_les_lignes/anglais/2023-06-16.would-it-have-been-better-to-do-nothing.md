        text: 'But there was an issue: what if one of the companies in the portfolio was bought (takeover bid)? This was indeed the case for three of the 17 companies in the portfolio over the 10 years following 2012. I opted to reinvest the sums obtained during takeover bids to buy back, in the same currency, each of the remaining positions of the portfolio according to their percentage of the portfolio at the time of the takeover.'

        text: 'I would first remind you that this portfolio is real and that it has been managed by COTE 100 since the very beginnings of the Financial Bulletin in 1988. Most of the stocks recommended in the Bulletin are purchased there. The portfolio pays transaction fees, receives dividends and interest.'

        text: 'First, this portfolio of 33 securities recorded a compound annual return of 12.6% from December 31, 2012, to December 31, 2022. An excellent performance which indicates that the portfolio of American stocks has done slightly better than the Canadian, in part due to the appreciation of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar. In addition, six companies in the portfolio were the subject of takeover bids during the period. None went bankrupt.'

Thus, the stocks that performed best on the stock market would have monopolized a significant share of the portfolio after 10 years. Here they are, along with their hypothetical portfolio weights as of December 31, 2022 ans their 10-year compound annual returns (dividends included):'

No. In the real portfolio, this stock represents 5.4%. In fact, the longer the exercise (20 years or 30 years), the more the portfolio would have naturally concentrated on a few stocks – we would probably have ended up with weightings of the order of 25% or more in a few stocks.'

        text: 'I have drawn several conclusions from this reading. First, the late 1920s was a time of unbridled optimism and speculation was rampant. Speculators bought on margin and many of them speculated in the stock options market. The general feeling was that the economic outlook was very positive and that the stock markets could only continue to appreciate.'

It is what Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet said at the recent annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, comparing the stock market in recent years to a “gambling parlour”.'

It allows us to better understand what the potential devastating consequences of unbridled speculation on the part of many “investors” can be. If only for this reason, the book is worth its weight in gold.'

chapeau: 'I just finished reading “The Great Crash 1929”, by John K. Galbraith. It is a detailed account of the famous stock market crash of 1929. First published in 1954, this classic has steadily regained popularity in subsequent decades, new printings having been made in 1955, 1961, 1972, 1979, 1988, 1997 and 2009, periods roughly coinciding with the low periods of the stock markets. I wonder if there will be a 2022 or 2023 edition?'

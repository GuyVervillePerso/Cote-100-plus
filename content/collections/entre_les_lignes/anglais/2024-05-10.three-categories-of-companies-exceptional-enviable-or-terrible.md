Furthermore, things change over time and an exceptional company can become rather ordinary over years or decades.

        text: 'An exceptional company obtains a high return on its invested capital and can reinvest its profits to obtain high rates of return. Also, its business model is protected by high barriers to entry which allow it to persist and maintain high profitability. These barriers to entry act like a moat that prevents competitors from “penetrating” a company’s economic castle.'

        text: 'There are multiple barriers to entry. They include a recognized brand, low costs linked to strong economies of scale, an unrivalled and difficult to replicate distribution network, patent protection, regulation of an industry, the need to invest enormous capital, etc.'

        text: 'These companies are by definition exceptional and therefore very rare. I think investors can count themselves lucky to have a handful of them in their portfolio. If you own such a company, it is important to keep it as long as possible.'

        type: text
        text: 'There are more companies that I would call “enviable”. They are profitable, even very profitable, and obtain a high return on their capital. This return is, however, lower than that of exceptional companies: let’s say between 10% and 15% compared to the 15% and more for exceptional companies.'

        text: 'There is nothing wrong with owning such stocks in a portfolio. Often, these companies will provide us with good long-term returns, although they will be significantly lower than those of exceptional companies. Also, these companies will require closer monitoring because their commercial and financial success could decline and possibly be reversed.'

        type: text
        text: 'An investor should avoid these companies at all costs. They are generally not very profitable, if at all. While they make profits, their return on invested capital is anemic (less than 10%) and often lower than their cost of capital.'

        text: 'Once you get to know some exceptional companies, it is quite easy to identify others. But as I said, these companies are extremely rare; this is why their stocks most of the time trade at very high valuation levels.'

        text: 'However, sometimes, for whatever reason, the stock of such a company corrects on the stock market and trades at a reasonable valuation. This is then a golden opportunity to invest.'

        type: text
        text: 'As for the price paid, I have learned over time that you have to be prepared to pay more for high-quality companies. As for so-called enviable companies, I believe that you have to buy their shares at very attractive valuation ratios if you want to get attractive returns over the years. When it comes to stocks of terrible companies, no price would be low enough to attract us.'

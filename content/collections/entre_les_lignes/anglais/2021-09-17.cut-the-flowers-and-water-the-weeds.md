        text: "“I am in a dilemma right now. I am a long-term investor and started on the stock market 5 years ago. This is not the first time that I have written to you. I own TFI transport which I bought for $36 and is now priced at $141. For the first time in five years, I wonder if I shouldn't take a profit by selling half of my shares or keep all of my shares in TFI for another 10 years. I have this hesitation because I read a lot of articles on profit taking. Basically, I wonder if profit taking applies for a long-term investor?”"

        text: 'On the one hand, potential stock returns are asymmetric. When buying a security, the potential return of that security is theoretically infinite, while the potential loss is limited to 100% (unless you invest on margin). If, as an investor, you consistently sold every security that has appreciated 50% or 100% from your original cost, you would lose all the stock market advantage over the long term. Such a method reminds me of the general manager of a professional hockey team who would systematically trade in their best players and replace them with new draft picks.'

At COTE 100, we have been fortunate to have had a few of these over the past many years. Stocks such as Alimentation Couche-Tard, CGI, Visa, Accenture, and Berkshire Hathaway have greatly rewarded us and have contributed to our returns over the years.'

As part of our management, we have established a discipline of developing an initial buy scenario whenever we decide to invest in a new security. This scenario sums up our in-depth analysis in a few lines and summarizes the reasons we believe make a security a buy. Once the security is acquired, we follow up on it at least quarterly when the company's quarterly results are published. It’s also an opportunity to make sure that our scenario is still valid; otherwise, we will choose to sell the stock."

If the price of the security is significantly outperforming your valuation, you may want to reduce your position somewhat. Over the years, we have learned that it is indeed better to reduce a position in a security that we believe has become too expensive than to sell it all.'

        text: 'For me, Federer is the greatest player in the history of tennis, period. Some will contradict me, pointing out that Nadal, with his 22 Grand Slam titles, or Djokovic, with his 21 titles, surpass Federer and his 20 titles. Others will say that Federer cannot be considered the GOAT (Greatest of All Times) when he registered more losses than wins against Nadal (16 wins – 24 losses) and Djokovic (23-27). In fact, I believe that Nadal is not very far behind Federer in the list of the greatest in the sport.'

        text: 'I base my judgment on the whole character that is Roger Federer and the overall impact he has had on the sport over the past two decades. I think not only of the way he played tennis, the unique grace, style, and creativity of his game, I also think of the way he behaved on and off the court throughout his career, and the extraordinary example he set for his fans and young tennis enthusiasts. Federer raised the image of tennis to an unparalleled level in its history.'

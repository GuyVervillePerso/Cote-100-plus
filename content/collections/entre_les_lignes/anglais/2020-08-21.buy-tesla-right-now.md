        text: "With Tesla's share rising 390% since the start of the year, shareholders have benefited greatly from the trend towards the electrification of transportation. Since going public in 2010 at a price of $17, the stock has risen 62% annually to reach more than $2,000 as of this writing. The stockhas doubled in the past two months. It’s precisely this latest increase that prompts us to be cautious because in our opinion it’s more justified by the investors’ behaviour than by the company's growth prospects. I invite you to read or reread Philippe Leblanc's last monthly post (link) and you’ll be able to draw a parallel with the Tesla stock."

        text: "I’d add two events that have nothing to do with the intrinsic value of the company. The first is the company's 5-for-1 stock split announced on August 11. Now that it’s possible to buy fractions of shares in several brokerage firms, it’s unlikely that a price of US$400 per share will significantly increase the demand for the company's shares compared to a price of US$2,000 per share. In any case, this is certainly not news that changes our estimate of the intrinsic worth of the company. We therefore don’t understand the 13% increase in the share price the day after this announcement."

        text: "The second event is the possible inclusion of the company in the S&P 500 Index following the publication of earnings for a fourth consecutive quarter. The inclusion of the stock in this index would have a significant impact on demand for Tesla shares. It’s difficult to calculate the demand from passive investors who aim to replicate the composition of the index, but some analysts anticipate that 20% to 25% of freely traded stocks could end up in index managers’ hands. At the current price, this would represent a demand of approximately US$65 billion. In my opinion, some investors are probably trying to take advantage of this demand by buying stocks in anticipation of reselling them to index managers who will be forced to buy if there’s an announcement of the stock's inclusion in the index. This situation is unheard of as the company is now the eighth largest US company behind the tech giants, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa and Johnson and Johnson."

        text: "Of course, the share’s rise over the past two months can surely be justified, and analysts have plenty of arguments to justify it. Many argue that Tesla should be viewed as a technology company and not an auto maker or even as an energy company because it produces batteries for power producers. Without passing judgment on the validity of these arguments, we’d instead tend to take risks into account in our valuation of the company and understand that certain one-off events currently affect the price of the security without changing our estimate of the intrinsic value of the company. Without making a formal recommendation, we’d be tempted to recommend that investors buy a Tesla instead of the company's stock, even though we generally view buying a car as a poor investment."

  Buy Tesla right now? One of the greatest stock market successes of recent years is undoubtedly Tesla. The company founded by visionary Elon Musk has greatly promoted the adoption of electric vehicles as a viable alternative to combustion engine cars. Initially developing a niche product for early stage buyers, the company has been able to lower battery production costs while improving battery performance, which now enables mass adoption. One can debate the economic attractiveness of buying an electric car today, but I believe that debate will be resolved in five or ten years, when the production costs of electric cars will decrease and the performance of batteries will increase. Few today doubt that a significant portion of future auto sales will come from battery-powered cars. While some may still doubt it, it’s interesting to note that in Norway, a pioneering country in this domain, 65% of car sales since the start of 2020 involve electric or rechargeable vehicles.

        text: 'Faced with an important decision, we should in my opinion take the time to compare the choices that are presented to us in a thoughtful and objective manner. For example, over the years I have developed the habit of using a table to help me objectively rank the various choices available to me or my family. Such a table can also be used in investment or in business. It presents the various alternatives available to me as well as a list of the selection criteria that I think are important. I can even assign various weights to the selection criteria depending on the relative importance of each.'

        text: "I think this way of doing things has served me well in the past by largely eliminating the influence of emotions in the selection process.\_The investor is constantly bombarded with investment possibilities. The sources of investment ideas come from everywhere, from friends, from your broker, from the media and especially from the internet. How to choose given so many possibilities?"

        text: 'My father, Guy Le Blanc, developed the COTE 100 System almost 35 years ago to help him filter the stock markets and only retain securities that met his basic criteria (17 criteria divided into three categories: financial health, financial performance and valuation). The reasoning behind the COTE 100 System strangely resembles the table presented above!'

        text: 'There are thousands of listed companies in North America. It is unrealistic for a particular investor to be able to investigate all of them. In my opinion, it is better to develop your own filter to focus on a limited number of companies that meet your selection criteria.'

        text: 'Like Charlie Munger, I suggest that you reverse the selection process by first eliminating the industries and types of companies you wish to avoid. For example, we generally stay away from natural resource sectors and avoid companies that are unprofitable or have too much debt.'

        text: 'However, I would add something that will make the selection criteria even more stringent: this potential new investment should be at least more attractive than the security that you consider to be the least attractive of your holdings in the portfolio. If it is not, forget about it or classify it as one to watch for as a potential future investment.'

        text: 'The best investors are particularly selective in their choice of investment. In our management, I would say that we might at the very least consider 500 securities before deciding on one that we will add to our portfolios.'

        text: 'By asking yourself this question: “Is this security at least more attractive than the least attractive of the securities in my portfolio?” », you will ensure that the quality of your portfolio is improved over the long term and you will significantly reduce the number of transactions you make.'

chapeau: "With limited resources, whether it's the time available or the money we have, we must constantly make choices in life. And each of these choices is usually exclusive – we'll choose A over B, or vice versa, but rarely will we be able to choose both."

        text: 'I would say, however, that the assessment of a management team is very subjective and that it is largely based on judgment and interpretation. In addition, each investor will have their own selection criteria based on their personal values. For example, many swear by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, while I, for one, disagree with many of his ways of doing things.'

Here are some of the criteria I would use to rate the management team at this company (which I will not name). In order to make reading easier, I plan to split this blog over a few weeks:'

        text: 'If a president has been in charge of a company for many years, you should be able to get a good idea of his performance by examining the evolution of its stock since his appointment. If the president was recently appointed, then we can trust her track record – has she created shareholder value in the past?'

        text: 'In the case of the company I analyzed, the current president was appointed in 2014, which is a relatively short period to assess his work. However, he has worked for the company since 1983 and has risen through the ranks over the years. He was previously named VP Information in 2009. It can be said that he knows the company culture very well and has certainly had an impact on the company’s performance over the past many years.'

        text: 'Since 2014, the stock of the company in question has recorded an annual compound return of 12.6% (without taking dividends into account); in 10 years, the annual compound return has been 10.3% (always without dividends) and 13.7% over 20 years (without dividends). In short, in terms of value creation, I think we can say that the management team passes the test with flying colours. Grade: A +.'

        text: 'Personally, I believe that executives who do exceptional work and create long-term value for their shareholders should be paid handsomely. On the other hand, the opposite is perhaps even more important: those who don’t deliver the goods should not get rich on the backs of their shareholders. Ideally, we are looking for companies that have reasonable executive base salaries. Of course, the term “reasonable” is very subjective and will depend, among other things, on the size of a business and its industry. It’s a good idea to compare them to those of similar companies in the same sector.'

        text: 'In this case, the salaries of the executive officers seem particularly reasonable to me: all of its members have an annual base salary of $100,000 or $120,000. I have to admit that I have rarely seen this over the years; the only example that comes to mind for a large company is Berkshire Hathaway where Mr. Buffett’s annual salary is $100,000.'

        text: 'It’s difficult to find a better way for officers and directors to work for their shareholders than if they themselves are large shareholders. Again, the question is subjective: one cannot expect an executive who was not the founder of a company to hold a high percentage of its shares. You also have to consider the size of the business: owning 1% of a mega-business is probably more than owning 20% of a mid-cap company. What matters to me is the cash value of the shares that the leaders own.'

But how do you do it before success is already achieved and the P/E ratios are not necessarily subject to deflate at the slightest disappointment?"'

title: 'Time Arbitration'
chapeau: "In my book, _Avantage Bourse_, I wrote this about time arbitration:\_“When the majority of investors have a short-term horizon and most of them prefer immediate gratification, it becomes even more profitable to adopt a strategy that truly focuses on the long term in one’s investments.”"

These stocks are often ignored by hordes of speculators and therefore display reasonable valuations.'

        text: 'An example: we acquired the stock of the Hershey Company last March. In my opinion, it is difficult to find a less “spectacular” business model than that of this confectionery manufacturer – the company is the North American leader in chocolate bars. But the company is very profitable (return on invested capital of 24% for ten years), in excellent financial health and its stock was trading at around 18 times expected profits when we bought it. I suspect this assessment was because the company will not experience strong growth in the coming years, unlike some technology or artificial intelligence companies. At the same time, I am convinced that we will still be eating chocolate in 25 years and that Hershey will probably still be a leader in its industry. Can the same be said of most tech companies?'

        text: '“From time to time, we are asked by prospective shareholders to describe our principal competitive advantages. They invariably expect us to cite the land we own, our international buyer base, and our best-in-class technology platform. And that reasoning has merit. But it mistakes cause and effect. Our critical competitive advantage is our ownership mindset and, by extension, our investment horizon. We live and codify ‘Be an Owner’ as one of our core Copart values. As modelled by our Founder and Executive Chairman Willis Johnson, we make business decisions with the 30-year prosperity of our clients and ourselves as the ultimate objective. As a result, we are empowered to invest in land, technology, capital equipment, auction liquidity, and our people. For example, at any given moment, it is ‘cheaper’ to lease than to buy the facilities through which we serve our customers. We know, however, given how difficult it is to permit and develop new facilities, facility ownership is essential to ensuring the long-run sustainability of our service offerings… In countless other ways, large and small, our long-run orientation creates distinctive advantages for Copart, particularly as other industry participants are forced to optimize for short-term considerations.”'

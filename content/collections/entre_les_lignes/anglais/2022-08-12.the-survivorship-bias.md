The image below depicts a hypothetical damage distribution for aircraft returning from combat. The red dots indicate the location of the bullet holes.'

His reasoning was simple: since you don’t see bullet holes on the engines, they’re probably on the planes that never returned to base. Conclusion: the analysis of the army officers was biased by the surviving planes.'

You conclude that investing in the stock market is relatively easy and very profitable. Warning: You are dealing with survivorship bias! Investors who failed have certainly left the forum while those who have achieved mediocre returns probably no longer publish their performance. On the forum, you don’t see all those “day-traders” who failed and disappeared.'

  By Jean-Philippe Legault, guest contributor

  During World War II, the Allies created a research group whose objective was to solve military problems. One of the group’s mandates was to examine the distribution of damage suffered by aircraft returning from combat. The purpose of the exercise was to provide advice on how to improve aircraft and reduce military casualties.

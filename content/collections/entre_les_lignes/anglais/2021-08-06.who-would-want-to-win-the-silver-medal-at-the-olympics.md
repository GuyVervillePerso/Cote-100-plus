        text: 'The researchers explain this phenomenon, which has been happening in several other events, by the counter-factual thinking of analyzing what would have been the result if the events had unfolded differently; in other words, the athletes build an alternate reality. It is probably easier for the silver medalist than the bronze medalist to imagine a scenario where he wins the gold medal. Conversely, it is easier for the bronze medalist to design a script where he is excluded from the medals.'

Rather, they will tend to look for situations that have aroused positive emotions, such as buying back a stock that has declined since it was sold.'

He should remember that he is the second-best boxer in the world in his class.'

  As the debate rages mostly between Americans and the rest of the world over how to count the Olympic medal champion, whether it is the number of gold medals or the total of medals that matters, it may be interesting to analyze the psychological impact for athletes to finish on the second or third step of the podium. Used in a CFA Institute blog, a 1995 study by researchers Vicki Medvec, Scott Madey and Tom Gilovich carried out following the Barcelona Olympics found that athletes who win gold are generally happier than those who finish second or third. However, the bronze medal winner is consistently happier than the silver medalist.

        text: "But my opponent didn't see it that way. He refused to shake my hand and continued to argue with the referee. He even demanded that the tournament organizer come on to the court so he could present his case to him. After a few minutes of listening to him, I picked up my racket bag and walked off the court to head to the locker rooms. About half an hour later, after taking a shower and changing clothes, I came out of the locker room to find that my opponent was still arguing with the referees! He never accepted his defeat."

        text: 'I remember that in 2010 Couche-Tard attempted to acquire US-based Casey''s General Stores ("CASY"). Despite an offer that seemed attractive to the company''s shareholders, the company’s board of directors turned it down. At the time, Mr. Bouchard, after extending the deadline of his offer, had abdicated. It was, it seemed to me, a humiliating and very public failure for Couche-Tard and for Mr. Bouchard. Instead of being stubborn and upping its bid, the company pulled out like a good loser. Two years later, in 2012, the company made the major acquisition of Statoil Fuel & Refueling, an operator of some 2,300 convenience stores in Northern Europe, that has proven to be a great success for Couche-Tard shareholders.'

chapeau: 'I believe it was the summer of 1984. I was playing the final game of the Eastern Canada tennis tournament in the 14 and under category. I remember the last point very well, the match point: I was serving and the score was 5-3, 40-30, after winning the first set. I do my serve which hits the centre line - an ace! But my opponent calls the ball out. A long argument followed which ended with the referee ruling that the ball was on the line: I won the match!'

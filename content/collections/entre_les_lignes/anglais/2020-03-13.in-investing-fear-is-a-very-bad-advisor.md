        text: 'Fear has served mankind well throughout its history. If our ancestor saw a bush moving near him, it was better to run than to take the time to analyze the probabilities that a lion was hiding there, ready to attack. Fortunately, I believe that fear is inciting countries and the general population to take the necessary measures in the face of the threat of the coronavirus.'

        text: 'It’s therefore very difficult to ignore millennia of natural selection favouring the reflex of fear. The fact remains that, in managing one’s investments, fear is a very bad advisor and it’s better to trust one’s reason.'

        text: 'It’s true that the situation is frightening and that there is a lot of uncertainty. It’s also true that the markets could very well continue to fall, especially if the virus continues to spread in the United States and elsewhere in the world. That said, the investor should keep several things in mind before making a decision that he may well regret in a few years.'

        text: 'Remember that by investing in the stock market, you’re not buying pieces of paper, but pieces of real businesses. If you chose them well and followed them closely over the years, these companies are probably in good financial health. The strongest companies will adjust to the difficult conditions on the horizon. They could also emerge stronger from this crisis.'

chapeau: 'The reasons for being afraid are obvious. It would be difficult to find an event that causes more fear than a pandemic. The coronavirus is spreading around the world and forcing countries to take measures to control it, which will have a major impact on the world economy during a period that is difficult to define.'

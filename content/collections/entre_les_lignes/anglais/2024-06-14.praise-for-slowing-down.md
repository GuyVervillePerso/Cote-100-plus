For my next trip, I want to stop running around in order not to miss anything. This is the equivalent of the FOMO (“Fear of Missing Out”) concept that affects so many investors! Take the time to live like Europeans, sipping a drink on a terrace or reading a book in a park.'

It is wrong to think that you have to be active and make investment decisions every day to move your portfolio forward faster. If you have chosen your companies well and constructed your portfolio well, the best thing to do is generally to do nothing. Even if we take vacations, our companies don’t stop working for us.'

        text: 'I would like to return to this theme because I observed a similar incident in recent months. An investor with a large portfolio (worth a few million dollars) and who was a private management client of ours, made the decision to sell all his shares in November 2023. He was convinced that a strong stock market correction was awaiting us.'

        text: 'Second, I believe that the investor who makes the decision to sell will probably do so when conditions seem negative, and the general sentiment is pessimistic. Cast your mind back to the fall of 2023 and you’ll see that was the case. Interest rates were at their highest in many years, war had just been declared between Israel and Hamas, and media headlines seemed particularly defeatist. However, it is often when pessimism is at its height that stock markets are cheaper.'

        text: 'Coming back to the investor who sold all his shares last November, I assume that he still has not reinvested his portfolio in the stock market. He probably placed a large part of the proceeds of the sale in the money market, which gives him almost 5% in interest, and another part in bonds, which perhaps gives him a return of a little more than 5%. In both cases, the after-tax return will be almost half of that.'

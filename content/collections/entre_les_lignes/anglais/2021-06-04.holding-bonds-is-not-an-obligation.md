        text: "Right off the bat, I'm probably a little biased. Since I have been investing, over 30 years, I have never held any bonds. Actually, this is not entirely true: I owned one (from the National Bank) for a few months, which I acquired in the midst of the 2008-2009 financial crisis when the whole world was questioning the soundness of banks. The fact remains that I am an “equity man”. In the long run, I have always believed that it is better to be an “owner” than a “creditor”."

        text: "In my opinion, there is a problem with the popular “wisdom” that an investor should hold bonds in their portfolio and that the proportion should increase with age. Isn't it common to use the formula whereby the percentage of one's portfolio in bonds is equal to one’s age minus 20%? As a “contrarian” investor, I am wary of these general formulas."

        text: 'The first is that the investor should only invest in stocks the savings that he will not need for a long time, I would say at least five years, preferably 10 years or more. Any other money that an investor will need within five years or less should be invested in the money or bond market. In this case, the investor should be less concerned with the return '

        text: "I allow myself an aside here. A lot of retired and older people feel like they must have a lot of bonds. They don't have much income anymore and the bonds will theoretically come to fill the void. For many of them, this is probably the right thing to do as they cannot afford a significant drop in their portfolio while in disbursement mode. However, I know of many retirees who have accumulated savings far greater than their likely financial needs. I believe these investors should take a long-term investment horizon as their savings will most likely go to their estate. In such cases, equities should be favoured."

        text: 'In my opinion, the other reason for holding bonds is to significantly reduce the volatility of your portfolio in the short term. Think of March 2020. If you panicked when the markets fell almost 30% and sold your stocks during that time, then you should own bonds for a sizeable portion of your portfolio. If, on the contrary, you went through this strong correction (and perhaps also that of 2008-2009) without panicking, you were made to own stocks.'

        text: 'I would also add that the ultimate goal of the investor is that his savings allow him to buy more in the future. He therefore wants to ensure that he obtains returns at least as high as the future rate of inflation. However, historically and in the long term, equities have comfortably outperformed inflation, while bonds have a much more mixed history. With the rates currently offered by bonds, it seems to me that it will be almost impossible to beat inflation in the years to come.'

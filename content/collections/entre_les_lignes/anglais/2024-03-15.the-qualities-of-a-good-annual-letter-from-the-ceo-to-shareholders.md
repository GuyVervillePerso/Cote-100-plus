        text: 'Personally, I want to read letters that will teach me more about the company I own or that I am considering in my investments. I not only want to know what is going well, but above all, I want to know what is going less well, what are the challenges to overcome, the risks to consider. Basically, I want the truth!

The share of risks between us as the insurer and the buyers of that insurance did not match up appropriately.”'

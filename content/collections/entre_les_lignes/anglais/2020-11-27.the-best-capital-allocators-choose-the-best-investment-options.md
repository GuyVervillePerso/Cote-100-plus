        text: 'In my opinion, the great strength of the eight leaders highlighted in The Outsiders is their ability to properly allocate their business capital by opportunistically investing in the options that are most attractive to their business. In that way, they demonstrated their ability to go against the grain of what seemed to be popular opinion.'

        text: 'Assuming that a business has excess capital to invest, a business executive usually has several investment options: investing organically in their business in order to help it grow, paying off debt, paying dividends to shareholders, or buying back its shares. Each option should be assessed against the potential for future returns as well as the associated risks, while taking into account other possible constraints. For example, a company with relatively low trading volumes on the stock market might decide that share buybacks are not to its advantage.'

        text: 'It’s not surprising that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, the company he runs, were among the eight companies Mr. Thorndike selected in his book. Few companies have succeeded in creating as much value for their shareholders as Berkshire Hathaway and Mr. Buffett has repeatedly demonstrated his exceptional ability to invest company capital in a very efficient manner.'

        text: "I therefore draw your attention to the fact that Berkshire Hathaway has bought back more shares in the last few months than ever in its history. In fact, in its most recent quarter ended September 30, the company bought back for US$9.0 billion (all data in this text are in US dollars) of its shares, which we believe is the highest level of repurchases by the company in a single quarter. In the first nine months of 2020, the company's buybacks totaled $15.7 billion. These are substantial amounts, even for a company with a market cap of almost $535 billion."

        text: "On the other hand, I believe it can be concluded that Berkshire executives see few other attractive investment opportunities. It should be remembered that, unlike most publicly traded companies, Berkshire Hathaway has its eye on both investments in existing stock market companies and the full purchase of private companies. Of course, one of the constraints limiting Berkshire's investment possibilities is the size of potential investments - it has no choice but to consider investments of at least a few billion dollars."

        text: 'The best "allocators" of capital not only consider the potential returns of the various options available to them, they also consider the level of risk of each of those options. However, I believe that stock buybacks, assuming they are done at an attractive price, are generally the least risky option for a company. Because, unlike acquisitions, share buybacks don’t bring any unpleasant surprises.'
chapeau: 'The book The Outsiders, written by William N. Thorndike and published in 2012, presents eight presidents of companies who have created enormous wealth for their shareholders over periods of several years. In most cases, these presidents have been successful by patiently waiting for opportunities to acquire companies or repurchase shares at prices that are very beneficial for their shareholders. In fact, they were both very patient and very opportunistic, not hesitating to invest a substantial portion of their business capital in such occasions.'

For example, some could foresee the end of the world as we know it. Nuclear war or natural disasters could occur, rendering any attempt to make long-term stock market forecasts invalid. However, if we invest, it is because we believe or hope that such events will not occur. In my opinion, it is better to ignore such possibilities, even if one knows that they are possible. As portfolio manager and author Howard Marks once said,\_"

Is there any reason to believe that they will be very different in the next 100 years? What key factors could change in the next century compared to the last?'

To be conservative, let’s say they will be a little lower. As for population growth, it is foreseeable that it will decrease significantly over the next few decades. This is a trend that has started in recent decades. This is also a subject I talk about in my book\_"

I believe it is dangerous to bet against the ability of people and economies (not to mention businesses) to adapt and capitalize on the growth opportunities that arise. We can see climate issues as a huge risk to the economic growth of our planet or we can see them as a huge problem just waiting to be solved. I am of the latter camp.'

As for the stock markets, I also believe that we can bet on somewhat lower returns than in the past – I would say around 8%. Less, but still attractive compared to alternatives. More importantly, I continue to believe that equities will outperform the rate of inflation better than most alternatives.'

        text: 'Preparation. Each team is entitled to three minutes between each choice. So, they must arrive prepared for the draft. To do so, they’ll have a list of their favorite prospects. This list is established thanks to the work of the recruiting team who’ll have followed the candidate players for several months, even years.'

        text: 'The same principle applies to portfolio management. Investment opportunities are often short-lived. We only have to think about the most recent stock market decline in March. At that time, a stock investor had little time to discover new companies. Good preparation allows you to seize opportunities when they arise.'

        text: 'Qualitative assessment. Players are often assessed based on their previous statistics. A player’s historical performance can be a good indicator of future performance. However, this form of analysis remains incomplete. This is why recruiters also assess players based on qualities such as their character, their work ethic, their intelligence on the ice, their team spirit, etc. This qualitative analysis reduces the risks associated with the draft.'

Our analytical work must also include a qualitative component such as the assessment of barriers to entry, the quality of the company’s management team, the risks of the industry, etc. As with recruiters on a hockey team, this ability to analyze improves with experience. Past errors should result in new selection criteria.'

        text: 'Long-term vision. Players selected during the draft must be part of a long-term vision. Few players manage to enter the starting lineup in the first year. The team must assess a player’s ability to develop over the long term. Ten years passed between the time Carey Price was drafted in 2005 at the age of 17 and the time he won the Hart Trophy in 2015, the prize awarded to the player who was most valuable to his team; a great example of long-term vision and patience.'

        text: 'Our investment approach is based on the long term. A stock market investor who buys a security in the hope of seeing it appreciate in the short term is, in our view, much more speculative than investing. Eighteen years passed between our initial purchase of Alimentation Couche-Tard at $1.00 in January 2002 and its current price of $47.75. This total return of 4,675% was only possible with a long-term vision and patience.'

        text: 'Price paid. During the draft, the teams have a limited number of choices. When it’s their turn to select and one of their favorite players is still available, the team must decide whether to draft the player immediately or wait for the next round and hope that the player is still available. This approach is meant to optimize the selections by paying the best possible price.'

        text: 'A similar dynamic is present in portfolio management. The stock investor must decide between buying at the current price or waiting for a more advantageous price. However, it may never acquire it if the security does not fall to the hoped-for level. As in the case of the NHL Entry Draft, we believe it’s better to acquire an excellent player at a reasonable price than to acquire an ordinary player at a very good price.'

  It's now official! NHL activities will resume on August 1, 2020, when the playoffs begin. Fans will, however, have to wait until October 9 to follow the draft which is normally held in June. The NHL Entry Draft is when each team selects promising young players to join the current organization. Every year when I watch the event, I can't help but find similarities to portfolio management. Here are a few.

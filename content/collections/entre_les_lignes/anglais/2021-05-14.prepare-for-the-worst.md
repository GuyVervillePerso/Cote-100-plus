        text: 'In tennis, as in any sport, preparation is essential. Before a game, a player must prepare for several eventualities. If two players of roughly equal skill play against each other, the one who is better prepared should in my opinion win the match. For example, the player will have practiced a few days on the site of a tournament before playing his first match. He will also be informed about his opponent to know his style of play, his strengths and weaknesses. He will perform his pre-match preparation ritual to avoid any unpleasant surprises: warm-up on the court and in the locker room, meal, equipment check, visualization, development of the game plan (A and B), etc.'

        text: 'Just recognizing that a correction can come at any time is already a great way to mentally prepare for it. Because, I repeat, corrections are most of the time unpredictable and they can be caused by a myriad of equally unpredictable factors. Did you foresee the sharp correction of March 2020 caused by a pandemic? Or the 2008-2009 financial crisis caused by a sharp correction in the real estate market?'

        text: 'For example, the investor should know that from 1918 to 2018 there were 54 market corrections (one on average every 1.7 years), 20 bear markets (declines of 20% or more; one in every 4.6 years), 12 drops of 30% or more (one every 7.6 years) and three drops of 50% or more (one every 30 years). These numbers are obviously averages, but they give a good idea of the historical frequency of market corrections.'

        text: 'By being constantly on guard in the face of a possible market correction (and even more so when everything seems to be going well), we make sure to remain cautious in our investments and not get carried away by speculative investments or by fashions that regularly seize certain segments of the stock market. We also ensure that we have a well-diversified portfolio by asset class and that our equity portfolio is properly constructed. We also want to be sure that we have the financial resources to not only weather a possible stock market crisis, but also to be able to take advantage of it by taking advantage of the opportunities it presents to us. Investors who invest on margin are poorly prepared for a possible correction.'

        text: "Don't get me wrong: I'm not predicting a correction in the short-term. I do not believe that anyone is able to regularly predict market corrections. However, I believe that any investor should always be prepared for such an eventuality. As in tennis, whoever is best prepared for a correction will be the winner."
chapeau: 'A wise investor prepares for any correction to react better when it occurs.'

        text: 'A few years ago, the portfolio management firm Capital Group decided to create Funds made up of the best ideas of its many portfolio managers. Despite portfolios consisting exclusively of the best ideas, these funds have not achieved the expected returns. They all underperformed the market. One of the reasons behind this performance is that the "best ideas" were the stocks that managers spent the most time analyzing. The popularity of the stock was proportional to the time spent studying it.'

        text: '1. Eliminate quickly. The investor should quickly exclude companies that do not fit with his investment philosophy or his selection criteria. For example, if you are looking for companies with low debt, you should quickly rule out companies with high debt. In doing so, the investor avoids spending too much time looking for reasons to buy a security when the situation was fundamentally not promising. Early elimination serves to reduce engagement.'

        text: "2. Look for simplicity. The investor should analyze companies whose activities are simple and that fall within his circle of competence. In this way, he will be able to quickly identify and understand the issues, more easily assess the growth potential and determine if the price is attractive. In the video, Mohnish Pabrai gives the example of Warren Buffett's acquisition of Dairy Queen. He explains that this transaction was completed in just 30 minutes. Dairy Queen is a simple company that fits perfectly with Buffett's philosophy."

        text: ', the stock investor has every interest in studying the industry in which the company operates. At an annual meeting of shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett once mentioned that he made a lot of mistakes in his career. He stated that his mistakes were mainly due to a misunderstanding of the industry and/or the strengths and weaknesses of a company. His mistakes could not have been avoided by scrutinizing all the information and news surrounding the company. By spending more time studying the barriers to entry as well as the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, the investor will discover new companies and may be less “attached” to the original idea. He might even discover a better idea!'

Just being aware of this psychological bias helps avoid getting caught up in such a situation. With experience, the investor will quickly recognize good opportunities and will also know how to stay detached from a stock despite the important analytical work carried out. After all, the knowledge gained from analyzing a stock is never lost.'

  By Jean-Philippe Legault, guest contributor


  Last year, my colleague Jérôme Lafrance wrote an excellent blog about the various psychological biases that can affect investment decisions (read here). He discussed, among other things, confirmation bias, the illusion of control and overconfidence. I believe that the six biases presented in that text are among the most frequently encountered among independent investors. By their very nature, some psychological biases, such as engagement bias, affect professional portfolio managers like us more.

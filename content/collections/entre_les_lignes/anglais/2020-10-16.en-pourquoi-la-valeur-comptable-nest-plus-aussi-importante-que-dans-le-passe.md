        text: ', I wrote about the evolution in the composition of the stock markets by industry sector during the 20th century. In it we saw that the railroads represented 62.8% of the American stock market in 1900; in 2000, the weight of this sector was 0.2%. The same goes for the iron, coal and steel sector: it accounted for 5.2% of the stock market in 1900 and only accounted for 0.3% in 2000. These two industries use a lot of capital.'

        text: 'But more importantly, sectors that were insignificant (or nonexistent) in the stock market of 1900 have grown in importance during the 20th century. Thus, these sectors represented only 4.8% of the stock market in 1900 while they were worth 62.4% of the US stock market in 2000. According to the authors of the book “Triumph of the Optimists”, the source of all these statistics, the two industries which have taken on the most importance during the 20th century are Information Technology and Pharmaceuticals (23.1% and 12.1% respectively, for a total of 34.3% of the market).'

        text: 'However, these two industries generally require little capital. Companies like Microsoft or Apple, for example, are not manufacturers (they usually have their products manufactured by third parties) and their main assets are patents, trademarks and the expertise to develop new products, software and services. These assets have a great monetary value, but they can hardly be detected on the balance sheets of these companies.'

        text: "For example, Apple's stock is currently trading at almost $122 while its book value is $4.22, for a ratio of 28.8. As for Microsoft, the stock is trading at 14.2 times its most recent book value. Should we automatically conclude that these stocks are too expensive? No. In both of these cases, as with the majority of New Economy businesses, book value has lost virtually all significance. These businesses can continue to grow without having to invest substantial amounts of capital."

        text: 'Investors can still use book value as a valuation benchmark for the securities of certain companies that require a lot of capital. This is particularly the case with banks and insurance companies. This is also the case for public utilities and certain manufacturing companies. But for most other companies, the price-to-book ratio has lost all meaning.'

        text: 'I recently read in a Globe & Mail article that the price-to-book ratio of S&P 500 securities since 1973 has been 3.9, whereas it’s currently 12.6. It shouldn’t be concluded from this that the stock market is expensive, but that the nature of the stock market has changed completely over the past decades. And in my opinion, it’s a change for the better.'
chapeau: "Not so long ago, in the 1970s and 1980s, for example, the book value of a business was important information used by investors to value a business. Remember that book value is calculated by dividing the value of a company's shareholders' equity by its number of shares in circulation. In the book “The Intelligent Investor”, published in 1949 and written by Benjamin Graham, considered to be “the father of fundamental analysis,” Graham lists seven criteria for finding bargains on the stock market, one of which is the price-to-book ratio."

So, instead of wondering what to do to improve your yields, it would be better to ask yourself what not to do!'

In fact, according to a study by the firm Dalbar, the average American investor in equity mutual funds earned a compound annual return of 7.13% over the 30-year period between 1992 and 2021. For the same period, the S&amp;P 500 index returned 10.65%.'

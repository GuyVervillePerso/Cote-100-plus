        text: 'At that time, Amazon had just experienced the bursting of the technology bubble and its stock had lost no less than 78% of its value. Despite this drop, several pessimistic investors (“bears”) believed that the stock was still overvalued. Their main argument was that it was nothing more than a retail company and did not deserve such a high rating. They compared Amazon to Barnes & Noble and Walmart.'

Like Dell, Amazon operated its business online, shipped its products directly to consumers through fulfillment centres, and used no physical location or sales force.'

Nevertheless, the investor should be sure to keep an open mind when describing a company’s business model. Investors should constantly question their description in order to avoid tunnel vision.'

Over the past few years, I have heard plenty of talk from investors who describe Tesla as a technology company while others describe it as a traditional automaker. Obviously, the growth and profitability prospects of these two business models are very different. The parameters to be used in the evaluation process are therefore also different.'

As we saw above, my description of Tesla will inevitably affect my perception and therefore my assessment.'

  By Jean-Philippe Legault, guest contributor

  Last week, I explored the concept of mental models by drawing a parallel between meerkats and the network effect. As explained, mental models make it possible to use concepts from external fields, such as biology, in order to apply them to investing.

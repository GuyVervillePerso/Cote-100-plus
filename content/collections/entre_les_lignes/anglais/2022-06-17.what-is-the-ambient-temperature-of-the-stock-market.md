        text: 'In this book, Marks presents a chart to help investors navigate the stock market cycle. For Marks, we cannot predict the future, but we can try to understand what is happening in the present. Where are we in the economic cycle? Where do we stand in stock market cycles? Approximately where do we stand in the cycle of investor emotions?'

        text: 'Remember: we were trying to come out of the pandemic at that time and the economy was still in a sluggish and uncertain state. On the other hand, all other factors were “favourable” to a strong economic recovery. Interest rates were very low, the stock market was at its peak, and capital markets were in turmoil.'

An economic slowdown, or even a recession, seems more than likely in the coming months due to the sharp rise in interest rates observed in recent months and which will continue in the months to come.'

As for the state of the capital markets, I believe that we will soon be able to see from the results of North American banks how much this segment of their activities has slowed in recent months.

The rate of a 10-year US government bond is currently close to 3.45%, compared to 1.5% at the end of 2021. In addition, the average rate of a BAA-rated corporate bond currently stands at 5.48%, compared to 3.37% at the end of 2021.'

Perhaps these conditions will continue to deteriorate for some time to come, but it seems to me that the sharp stock market correction over the past few months is already discounting a very pessimistic scenario.'
chapeau: "On January 20, 2021, I wrote a blog titled \"What state is the stock market in?\"\_In this blog, I was inspired by the book “The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor”, written by Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management."

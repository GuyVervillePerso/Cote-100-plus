        text: 'In my opinion, the figures above illustrate some of the great upheavals of the last century. On the one hand, they demonstrate the declining importance of the economy and economic power of Europe, in particular of the United Kingdom, which at the turn of the 20th century was at the head of the largest colonial empire. On the other hand, the major emergence of the United States, whose value in 2000 represented almost half of all world market capitalizations. I would point out, however, that the year 2000 roughly corresponds to the peak of the techno bubble, which in my opinion certainly inflated the value of all world stock markets, but more particularly that of the American stock market.'

        text: "In addition, in 1900, India, then part of the British Empire, represented 10% of the world’s GDP. In 2000, Japan is the only significant representative of Asia. The country's performance in the last century, especially in the decades following World War II, seems to be a precursor to what might happen in Asia in the 21st century. Although in 2000, the Japanese market represented just over a quarter of the value of the US market, the book points out that its value exceeded that of the US market for a two-year period in the late 1980s; more than 30 years later, the Nikkei index is still only close to 40% of its peak in the late 1980s. In my opinion, however, it’s a safe bet that in 2100, Asia will capture a major proportion of the world's stock markets, much like the United States has done in the last century."

At the time, there were more than 20 other stock exchanges in the United States, and the total value of listed American companies is estimated by the authors at $3.5 billion. (Here I would be tempted to point out that, 120 years later, Apple alone is worth over $1,900 billion!). By the end of 1899, the shares of 783 companies were trading on the London Stock Exchange, more than six times as many as the 123 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.'

This compares to a value of $2.7 trillion for a total of 2,140 UK-listed companies.'

  I recently received a gift that I consider very valuable from a long-time friend. It was a book on financial markets called "Triumph of the Optimists", authored by Messrs. Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton (Princeton University Press, 2002).

        text: 'It is certain that an investor can make things particularly complicated. One has only to put in place stock option strategies for the level of complexity to explode. Some will try to set up “long-short” strategies which consist of buying securities for part of their portfolio (“long”) and selling securities “short” for another part. Others will try to multiply transactions each day, trying to take advantage of very short-term trends in securities or other types of investments.'

        text: 'Indeed, the world of investment and the stock market is infinitely complex. It is illusory to believe that you can reduce or eliminate this complexity by increasing the complexity of your investment process. On the contrary, I believe that the best way to reduce this complexity is to reduce this process to its simplest expression.'

Those with the knowledge, time and discipline can invest in stocks themselves, but they should do it the Buffett way: by patiently choosing stocks of quality companies at good prices and holding them for the long haul, and by adequately diversifying their portfolio;'

The stock market's historical return of nearly 10% is a more appropriate benchmark;"

        text: 'To succeed in the stock market, the difficulty does not lie in the method to adopt; rather, it comes from the discipline, perseverance and patience required to apply it rigorously for decades.'
chapeau: "One gets the impression that the world of finance and investment is very complex. That to succeed, you need a series of diplomas, including in mathematics, programming, or psychology, in addition to having of course obtained your CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation or a master's degree in finance."

Another source of inspiration comes from current events in the business world and the stock market. Another from our management clients and our subscribers to the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin. In short, I try to glean ideas from a variety of places through my reading of financial newspapers and company annual reports, as well as on the Web.'

        text: 'In my humble opinion (I am far from being an expert in the field), artificial intelligence will be able to perform an increasing number of tasks in the coming years. This is especially true for work that is repetitive or routine in nature. This is also true for much of what concerns numbers and the mechanical manipulation of formulas and computer programming and algorithms.'

        text: 'But what about the creative side? Where the human will continue to stand out from the computer is in its ability to weave links between seemingly totally different domains and to propose solutions to problems that are often off the beaten track. In my book Avantage Bourse, for example, I drew many analogies between long-term investing and the very different world of tennis, a field in which I have evolved since my childhood. I doubt a computer would make such a connection unless encouraged to do so.'

Artificial intelligence will be an indispensable tool to facilitate the work of the author or the portfolio manager, but it will not replace his ability to create, innovate or interpret a lot of often contradictory information to arrive at a decision.'

The creative process goes through mistakes, through multiple iterations that will eventually lead to a different innovative result. I am far from convinced that artificial intelligence will one day be able to achieve the same creative results as humans.'

        text: 'On the stock market, I believe that many investors are worried about the arrival and development of artificial intelligence. It does indeed represent a threat to many sectors of activity, and AI should be one of the questions we ask ourselves before investing in a company on the stock market. But personally, I associate AI more with an attractive growth opportunity for years to come than with an existential threat.'

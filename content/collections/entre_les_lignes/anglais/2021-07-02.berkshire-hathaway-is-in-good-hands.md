According to the figures provided, Mr. Weschler indicated that he succeeded in growing the value of his IRA account from $70,385 at the end of 1989 to $131 million in 2012. On that date, he opted to convert his IRA into a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is similar to a TFSA in Canada.'

Taking into account the maximum possible contributions, I estimate that Mr. Weschler made a compound annual return of approximately 32.3% from 1990 to 2018. He said that he achieved this performance by investing only in public companies.'

During the same period (1990 to 2018), the stock of Berkshire Hathaway made an annual compound return of 13.1% compared to 9.3% for the S&P 500 (including dividends). However, the 32.3% performance achieved by Ted Weschler is simply spectacular. Achieving such a level of performance over such a long period shows that Mr. Weschler is a competent investor.'

        text: '2. Concentration. I believe that this performance could only be achieved by investing in a relatively concentrated portfolio. Formerly Senior Portfolio Manager at Peninsula Capital Advisors, Ted Weschler used to manage a relatively concentrated portfolio there. This strategy was therefore most likely used in his personal accounts. Here is an overview of the top five positions in his US $2 billion Peninsula fund as of June 30, 2011. This is the last regulatory deposit before he started his employment with Berkshire Hathaway and as a result the last before the closure of the fund.'

        text: '4. The importance of the fiscal impact. Often underestimated, the tax impact is a determining factor in the net returns of a portfolio. During the period, Ted Weschler had the advantage of paying tax only once, when he converted his IRA to a Roth IRA. Specifically, he paid $28 million in taxes in 2012. If he had never paid tax, I calculate that he would have made a compound annual return of 33.5% and I estimate that the value of his account in 2018 would have been $336.0 million instead of $264.4 million. An investor who would have made an identical return, but who would have been required to pay 20% tax annually on his capital gains would have had a balance of only $91.9 million on the same date. Along the same lines, I invite you to '

Our portfolios are relatively concentrated, holding a maximum of 30 securities. We are committed to the long term and carefully select our securities. And we do relatively few transactions. In addition, unlike holding a basket of securities, our private management clients hold each security individually. This advantage allows us to optimize the taxation of each account by attempting to reduce capital gains."

Since we hold the stock in most of our portfolios, we are pleased to know that such a capable individual holds an important position at Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett seems to have wisely selected the leaders who will take over."

  Â 

  I recently came across an article published by ProPublica which revealed the value of certain personal assets held by Ted Weschler. Working alongside Warren Buffett and Todd Combs, Ted Weschler is an investment manager at Berkshire Hathaway.

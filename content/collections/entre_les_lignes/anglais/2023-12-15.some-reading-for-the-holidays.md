        text: 'I’m getting ready to go on vacation for the holiday season. I will admit that it will be good to spend some time in warmth with my family, thinking about something other than the stock market. Besides playing tennis, I plan to sit on a beach chair often (and for long periods) and read! And to stay away from the stock market and business field, I plan to avoid books on the stock market and on business management. Novels will be on my agenda!'

I like these books because they allow us to understand the management philosophy of entrepreneurs who have had resounding successes during their business careers, but also because they allow us to understand how they subsequently decided to give their fortune to the community.'

        text: '“Two hunters hire a plane to take them to a remote wilderness to go moose hunting. When they reach their destination, the pilot tells them they can each take back only one moose, because any more weight than that will strain the engine and they won’t make it back. Two days later the plane returns to pick up the hunters, and both hunters have killed two moose each. Too much weight, the pilot says. ‘Aww, you told us that last year, and we each gave you a $1,000 extra and you flew us back,’ says one of the hunters. So the pilot agrees. Sure enough, after a short while the plane’s engine sputters, and the pilot is forced to make a crash landing. Once on the ground, the dazed but unhurt hunters stagger out. ‘Where are we?’ asks one hunter. ‘I don’t know,’ replies the other, ‘but it sure looks a lot like where we crashed last year.”'

        text: 'I found this joke particularly appropriate, probably because it applies very much to what I’ve been seeing in the stock markets for the past few months. I can hardly understand it, but it seems to me that, like the two hunters in our story, many investors too easily forget the stock market lessons of the past.'

        text: 'I have written a few times over the past few weeks about the unbounded enthusiasm of independent investors for the stock market and for what is called "day trading." Since the start of the pandemic, discount brokerage firms have all been taken by storm by individuals who suddenly want to invest in the stock market. Many of them engage in particularly risky strategies involving the use of margin and buy options or short selling. This unprecedented enthusiasm is reflected in a record number of companies making the leap to the stock market (initial public offerings), many of them through the SPAC mechanism ('

        text: 'The current situation reminds me strangely of the late 1990s when a large number of individuals engaged in the practice of "day trading". For a few years, this practice had worked for most of them as technology stock, or rather anything that touched the Internet directly or indirectly, was in a gold rush. At the time, many people had decided to quit their jobs and devote themselves full time to day trading.'

        text: 'If you are one of those speculating in the market today, you should be aware of what happened from 2000 onwards when the dot.com bubble burst. Most day traders lost everything and didn’t return to the stock market for many years. The Nasdaq Index, largely made up of technology companies, hit its then all-time high (around 4,700) in February 2000, before undergoing a correction of some 75% over the next 21 months, reaching almost 1,170 in September 2002. The index recovered in the years that followed, but I believe few people realize that took almost fifteen years, or until October 2014, before the index returned to its highest level of 2000.'

        text: 'Memory is a faculty that forgets ... especially when it suits us to forget. I have the distinct impression that I am again seeing the excesses of the late 1990s with investors. And as was the case then, everyone continues to party like there is no tomorrow. However, as the story above reminds us, in the long run, overloading an airplane can only lead to unfortunate consequences.'
chapeau: 'In his book "John Neff on Investing", famous investor John Neff (1931-2019) shared this little hunting story that I find eye-opening, especially in today''s stock market environment:'

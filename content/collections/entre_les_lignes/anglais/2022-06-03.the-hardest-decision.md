        text: 'A consideration should relate to the analysis that one makes of the business model of a company. When we buy a security, we write a “purchase scenario” of a few lines that give the reasons for our decision, including the qualities of its business model and the risks that weigh on its activities. Of course, things inevitably change over time, for better or for worse, and you have to constantly question your initial purchase scenario. When we consider that the scenario no longer holds water, the stock should be sold.'

        text: 'also believe that you should avoid selling a stock simply because it has appreciated strongly. Or, on the contrary, because it has lost a lot of value. In both cases, the decision should depend on our estimate of the intrinsic value of a security. How does this estimate (which we want to be as objective as possible) compare to its market value?'

        text: 'Over the years, I became more and more convinced that it was better to adopt a discipline of two levels of patience: to remain very patient with your winning securities and much less tolerant of your losing ones. But in any case, the decision to sell (or not) a security should be based on facts and, as much as possible, ignore the many psychological biases that make this decision so difficult.'
chapeau: 'What is the hardest decision for an investor? There is no doubt in my mind that it is to sell a company’s shares.'

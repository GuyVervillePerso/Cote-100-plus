        text: 'For example, in the context of the past few months, an investor could‘ve been tempted to use options in order to partially cover his maximum loss by carrying out what is called a “Protective Put”. This strategy can be compared to an insurance contract: the client pays a premium to the insurer to protect themselves in the event of a claim. In the investor’s case, the insurer is the seller of the option. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, the graphic representation of the strategy allows us to better understand its impact.'

        text: 'The data is as follows: as of January 1, 2020, our investor owns 1,000 shares of SPY for which he paid $305.00 a share. On March 3, as of the end of the first correction, he decided to buy 10 Put contracts whose expiration is June 30, 2020 and the exercise price is $275. On this date, the option is trading at an approximate price of $11.10, which represents a total premium of $11,100 that the investor will have to pay.'

        text: 'On the graph, the green line represents the return on the portfolio without options and the blue line represents the return on the portfolio with hedging. In the exceptional context of the past few months, this strategy would have enabled the investor to limit his losses to a maximum of 17.9% during the off-peak period (the exercise price of the option being higher than the price of the underlying security). The strategy would therefore have avoided the worst of the fall of the S&P 500 which, at its lowest, had lost 30.75% of its value. On the other hand, at the time of expiration (June 30, 2020), we can see that the hedged portfolio generates a lower return due to the amount of the premium paid (the strike price being lower than the price of the underlying security, the value of the option is $0).'

        text: 'Obviously, this is just one example among a multitude of possible scenarios. For example, the investor could have decided to sell the option contract at the dip and pocket the capital gain. However, this strategy, being pure speculation, greatly increases the risk of the portfolio and doesn’t fit in with the philosophy of long-term investing. In reality, I believe that very few investors would have chosen this path; most would rather have been very happy to keep their insurance as general fear peaked.'

        text: 'With the growing popularity of option trading, there are more and more platforms that offer this type of product to all investors, regardless of their level of knowledge. One shouldn’t forget that, unlike stocks, options don’t create value for the investor; the gains of one are the losses of the other. For the informed investor and institutions, options are a very interesting instrument, because they allow not only to protect a portfolio of stocks, but also for the investor to apply a very specific strategy by combining several options between them. Some of the best-known strategies include "Call Spread", "Put Spread", "Straddle" and "Strangle". I’d like to emphasize this warning "For the informed investor […]" when it comes to options. Despite all their good sides, such speculative strategies or a poorly applied hedging strategy can cause substantial losses. A glaring example comes from the French bank BNP Paribas which, at the start of the crisis, suffered losses of more than $200 million due to a series of speculative positions in dividend derivatives. Even the biggest cannot predict the direction of the market.'

        text: 'In short, I believe that a good diversification strategy and an in-depth analysis of exceptional companies can build a much more stable portfolio, while avoiding spending large sums for hedging purposes or even making substantial losses because of a misunderstood strategy. Personally, I recommend a simple approach: KISS (“Keep It Simple, Stupid”).'

  For some time now, you may have noticed a marked increase in the popularity of derivatives. I’ve noted a clear increase in advertising related to derivative products. A quick analysis of the Google Trend tool for the search term "Option Trading" confirms this impression.

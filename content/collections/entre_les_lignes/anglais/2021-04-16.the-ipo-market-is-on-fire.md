        text: "I decided to talk about this today because it seems to me that the IPO market has been boiling for some time, a situation that has rarely been seen in the past many years. Who would have believed in March 2020, as the world was plunged into a pandemic and the world's stock markets plummeted, that a few months later the number of IPOs would hit record highs?"

The total includes IPOs, ADR issues (American Depository Receipts; i.e., American shares of foreign companies) and SPACs, a relatively recent (and very popular) mechanism which also allows private companies to access the Stock Exchange:'

        text: 'You can see in this graph that the IPO market, like most economic phenomena, is cyclical. It regularly goes from euphoria to agony, reflecting the general sentiment of investors for the stock market. During good times, the number of IPOs rises significantly, and investors are snapping them up, obsessed with the potential for rapid high returns and ignoring the risks inherent in such stock issues. In slow times, however, no one seems interested in investing in IPOs, feeling they are far too risky.'

        text: 'IPO waves usually occur when the stock markets are very favourable. In addition, it is the owners of these IPOs who dictate the price or valuation at which they will be willing to sell shares of their company. Do you really think they would make the jump to the stock market if the price was not particularly attractive to them? And do you think there are people in a better position than they are to objectively assess the value of their company? Much like what we are seeing in the Quebec real estate market, the IPO market is currently "a seller''s market".'

        text: 'Personally, I would be cautious of the wave of IPOs (whether they are traditional IPOs or through SPAC). In the longer term however, I can only rejoice that so many companies are coming to the market; for investors, this will create much more choice in the future and a better chance of securing bargain opportunities.'
chapeau: 'An IPO or “Initial Public Offering” is the process that allows a private company to enter the stock market and become a public company.'

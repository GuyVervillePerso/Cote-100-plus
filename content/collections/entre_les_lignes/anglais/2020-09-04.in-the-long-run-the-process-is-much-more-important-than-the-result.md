        text: 'Meanwhile, those who invest rationally, weighing the potential for appreciation as well as the risks - thus doing their homework - may earn mediocre returns. But in the long run, over many years, who do you think will perform the best? Which of the two investors would you bet on?'

        text: "I’d go even further. Although he made a quick buck, the investor who recently invested in Tesla's stock probably hasn't learned anything from his investment. He'll probably think making money on the stock market is easy; that all you need is a little flair. This is a particularly dangerous attitude that may cost him dearly in the future."

        text: 'A few years ago, I read the book More Than You Know: Finding Financial Wisdom in Unconventional Places (Columbia Business School), by Michael J. Mauboussin, which I really liked. Mr. Mauboussin was then chief strategist at Credit Suisse and author of three books on investment. One of the chapters I liked the most was about probabilities.'

By making rational and objective decisions, the results will not necessarily always be good in the short term, but they should be satisfactory in the long term.'

The one who prepares properly for a tennis match, who has checked each of the boxes of his preparation, and who plays his match according to his objectives, will not win all of his matches, but he or she increases the chances of winning more.'

chapeau: 'One of the problems with investing is that an investor who doesn’t do his homework and invests on the spur of the moment can very well achieve excellent returns. Anyone who acquired Tesla shares ("TSLA") on August 11, for example, would have obtained a return of some 60% in less than three weeks. I suspect many investors did just that without questioning too much because it was on August 11 that Tesla announced a 5-for-1 split of its stock. The result obtained by this investor is excellent, but can we say that his decision-making process was robust?'

        text: 'During the 17th century "tulipomania" in Holland, people believed that the prices of rare tulip bulbs could only go up. More recently, the Nifty Fifty bubble of the 1970s was based on the idea that America''s largest corporations would continue to dominate their industry for decades to come.'

        text: "It’s also how, at the beginning of 2019, an analyst from a large Canadian bank justified his assessment of a few stocks in the cannabis sector, including that of Canopy Growth (“WEED”) for which he established the value at $81 per share in one of his chosen scenarios. In this scenario, he predicted that by 2025, 20% of the world's population would have legal access to cannabis, of which 20% would consume $300 worth of cannabis products per year, which was his calculation of the “total addressable market”. Such a valuation justified a share price of nearly $65."

The company has a market capitalization of over US$45 billion, which compares to expected revenues of nearly $8.0 billion in 2021. The stock price of the company, which is still in deficit, is therefore assessed at nearly 5.3 times forecasted revenues for next year. A glance at '

        text: "Meanwhile, a company in the same industry that we’ve held in our portfolios under management for many years, CarMax (“KMX”), is considered a traditional company in the used car market because it has a network of more than 220 stores across the United States. For several quarters, CarMax has invested significant sums to develop its online offer. In its most recent quarter, it completed its multi-channel offering, allowing it to sell in person, online, or a combination of the two. According to management, in the most recent quarter, nearly 50% of customers completed at least part of their car purchase online. However, the company's market capitalization is $15.4 billion compared to expected revenues of nearly $21.9 billion in 2021, for a ratio of 0.70. And yes, the company is profitable, having grossed nearly $690 million in the last 12 months."

        text: 'With summer just around the corner, here are some recommendations for books I’ve read over the past twelve months (for several years now, I’ve given every book I read a rating out of five stars). I don’t know why, but the 2023-2024 vintage was particularly rich! To limit the list, I therefore stick to those that I rated five stars. I also tried to classify them into fairly broad categories.'

In my opinion, you have to take some and leave some in this type of book, but it is enough to find one or two good threads in them so that we can improve certain facets of our lives.'

chapeau: 'If there is one area where age has not yet slowed me down (unlike tennis!), it is reading. As my children become almost adult, I can devote more time to this passion that has brought me joy since my childhood, reading. It also allows me to broaden my horizons and go beyond finance and investment, which still remains a favourite field of mine. I have always loved reading good novels and books about history.'

        text: 'It seems to me, however, that the valuation risk is not the greatest risk for investors in the current pandemic environment. Indeed, we are currently going through a period of high uncertainty. No one knows what the state of the economy will be in a year or two, as it will largely depend on the evolution of the pandemic - will we or won’t we live through a second wave of contagion? The possible scenarios go from a severe depression to a strong economic recovery at the end of 2020. In this context, I believe that the greatest risk for the investor is the possibility that some of his companies don’t get through the current crisis - they go bankrupt.'

        text: 'Several companies that were in trouble before the pandemic have already filed for bankruptcy protection (including Hertz, Pier 1, Neiman Marcus, Whiting Petroleum and J.C. Penney). Others will no doubt follow in the weeks and months to come. The industries most at risk are those that we’ve already heard a lot about: traditional retail trade, restaurants, shows and entertainment, travel and tourism, hotels, etc. The difficulties of companies in these industries could spread to other sectors and to other companies.'

        text: 'The stock of a company like Amazon is certainly expensive, too expensive in my opinion. The fact remains that we can be almost certain that the company will not only survive the current crisis, but that it will greatly benefit from it to emerge even more dominant. You can certainly find a lot of securities from companies that are significantly cheaper than that of Amazon or Netflix. However, in many cases, one cannot be so certain that these companies will be able to weather the crisis.'

        text: 'Personally, in the current context, I believe that the investor should above all ensure that his companies will get through the crisis without too much difficulty and that they will emerge even stronger. Therefore, the valuation of a stock becomes a secondary consideration. Before thinking about winning a race, you first need to make sure you can finish it.'
chapeau: 'GUEST BLOG. Under normal economic conditions, I tend to believe that one of the biggest risks for investors is related to the valuation of a security. When things are going well, investors tend to project the economic conditions and the rapid growth of a business into the future. This regularly results in excessive valuations for many stocks, particularly those of companies in growth industries.'

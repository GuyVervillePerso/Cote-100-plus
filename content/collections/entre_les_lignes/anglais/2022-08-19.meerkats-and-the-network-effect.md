        text: 'Meerkats are small animals that live in southern Africa. They usually live in groups of 20 to 50 members. To protect themselves, meerkats use sentinels which, raising themselves on their hind legs, scan the horizon in search of predators. As danger approaches, the members are warned and run for cover. In addition to protecting themselves, meerkats also hunt collectively.'

        text: 'The size of the colony is crucial for the survival of the group. Indeed, a small colony of meerkats will not be adequately protected. A group of three to six meerkats, for example, is at greater risk of losing one to a predator. Such a loss then accelerates the destruction of the group. Thus, the survival rate of a small group of meerkats is low. The weakness of its community network is illustrated in section A of the graph below.'

        text: 'It is only from a certain point, say between 10 and 12, that the collective effect takes on its full meaning for the colony. Being now well protected, the colony will be able to feed properly and to reproduce. Thus, the arrival of new members in a well-established colony will drastically improve the strength of the community and the prospects for survival of the group. This rapid improvement is illustrated in section B of the graph.'

        text: 'At some point, the efficiency of the colony will peak, and the strength of the network may even decline. This situation occurs in the case of overcrowding. The decline could be caused by a lack of food or space in its environment. A large group also provides multiple targets for predators. This peak is illustrated in part C of the graph.'

  If you are a regular of Philippe Le Blanc’s blogs, you will probably have noticed the importance he places on mental models. Like him, I believe in the importance of these models since they serve to simplify abstract concepts or phenomena.

Indeed, I believe that there would have been two ways of obtaining returns equivalent to these: either by taking a lot of risk with speculative securities or by having invested significant proportions of one’s portfolio in the few securities which dominate the S&P 500, and which have done very well in 2021 (the cumulative weight of these securities was close to 27% of the US S&P 500 Index).'

Unless, of course, these stocks have gone down for good reasons and our initial investment needs to be called into question. When we realize that all our stocks have done very well over the course of a year, it is likely that the return obtained has reached its maximum – the stars were all aligned. In these situations, it makes sense to expect lower returns for the next year. Is this the case with your portfolio?'

This seems to me the right time to take stock and ask yourself many questions about your portfolio and the securities that make it up. Here is a good sample of questions you might ask yourself at the start of this year:'

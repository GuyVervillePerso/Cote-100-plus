        text: 'In times of crisis and stress, everyone''s reflex is to act, to make decisions in order to counter the threat. When faced with danger, we have two choices: fear the threat or confront it, the traditional response "Fight or Flight". To do nothing is not a normal option. In human history, most of those who didn’t respond to threats died as did their genes.'

        text: "This reflex to act generally serves us very well. Overall, the Quebec population is responding to the threat of the coronavirus. People are proactive: they’re taking the necessary measures by isolating themselves, reducing groupings, taking all the necessary precautions to minimize the risks. We are acting and it's heartening to see."

        text: "But on the stock market, I think the best thing for the investor to do is nothing. It goes against our normal reflexes. We all feel like we have to do something to counter the threat, but it's not a good idea."

        text: "I spoke to one of our investors this week who told me that he had weathered the 2008-2009 crisis by doing absolutely nothing with his investment portfolio. He didn't sell anything, bought nothing. He just sat on his hands. About a year after the crisis, his portfolio had recovered the loss suffered during the crisis. The decision to do nothing saved him many costs, including taxes and transaction costs."

        text: 'Above all, this decision saved him a lot of hassle. Because it must be repeated, the investor who sells today will end up with a cash balance which provides almost nothing in interest. It will also have to be reinvested one day. Will he be able to do it at the right time? I highly doubt it.'

        text: 'If you have a portfolio of quality companies, profitable and financially healthy businesses, the best thing to do is to do nothing. It’s likely that some companies will experience more difficulties than others, but most companies will be able to adjust, adapt and get through the crisis. Many of them will emerge stronger from this crisis. And your portfolio will eventually recover as was the case after the 2008-2009 financial crisis.'

        text: 'If the human reflex is to act in the face of a threat and in the face of stress, the long-term investor must, in my opinion, fight this reflex and convince himself to do nothing.'

        text: "If it helps, don't look at the stock quotes or your portfolio for a few more weeks. Don’t listen to the American financial channels which inexorably push action and panic. If you absolutely have to act to make yourself feel better, take a walk ... the good weather is coming!"

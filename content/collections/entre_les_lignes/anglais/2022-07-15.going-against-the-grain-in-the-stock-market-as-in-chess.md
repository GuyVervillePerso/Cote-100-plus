By playing these surprising moves, he hopes to destabilize his opponent and drag him into unusual and unanticipated situations.'

These problematic situations are often difficult to assess, and the risk of error is greater and more frequent.'

In the short term, he must accept to live with this uncomfortable situation.'

  Currently ranked number one in the world, Magnus Carlsen is unquestionably one of the greatest chess players of all time. His dominance for several years is all the more impressive since it came about in the modern era of chess.

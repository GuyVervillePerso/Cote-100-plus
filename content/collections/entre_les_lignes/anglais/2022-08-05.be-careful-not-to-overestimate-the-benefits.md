However, in the press release announcing its results, the company mentioned that it achieved diluted and adjusted net earnings per share of $2.42. To arrive at this figure, the company had to make several adjustments, such as excluding certain acquisition expenses and write-offs.'

  Every quarter, we analyze the results of the companies we hold in our portfolio and present a summary to our clients. It is not uncommon for our clients to ask us about our way of calculating the financial data of companies, especially earnings per share, which are often different from those published by the companies.

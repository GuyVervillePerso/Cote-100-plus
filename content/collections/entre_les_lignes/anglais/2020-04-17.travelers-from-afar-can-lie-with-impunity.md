        text: 'Over the past few weeks, I have been following the developments of a Chinese company that has curiously reminded me of the Sino-Forest case. You may have heard of the Chinese company Luckin Coffee ("LK"), a Chinese competitor to Starbucks, whose stock recently collapsed on the stock market. Much like Sino-Forest in 2011, Luckin’s stock collapsed by more than 75% on April 2.'

        text: "Apparently, some of the company’s executives, including its president (COO), had boosted the company's revenues by almost 40% since the second quarter of last year. It’s also interesting to note that Luckin's alleged fraud had first been pointed out by the firm specializing in short selling, Muddy Waters, the same company that had uncovered the fraud surrounding Sino-Forest."

        text: 'I believe that investors who think long term should try to take advantage of the future growth of emerging countries such as China. At the same time, I believe that investing directly in these countries is particularly dangerous. I believe that the best way to participate in the economic growth of these countries is to do so indirectly: through North American multinationals that operate in these countries.'

        text: 'If, like me, you believe that coffee houses in China offer great potential for the next many years, it’s much less risky to do so through Starbucks than through Luckin, even if the growth potential of Starbucks in China is diluted by its presence in many other countries in the world. This is the choice we made in 2019 by acquiring Starbucks shares in our managed portfolios.'

        text: 'The recent debacle of Luckin Coffee reminds us that when it comes to investing, the lure of a "beautiful story" cannot replace a rigorous fundamental and qualitative analysis. In fact, among the risks of investing internationally, one must not only take into account the high exchange and geopolitical risks, but also those linked to compliance, verification and transparency standards which are much lower than in North America.'

We favour companies that publish an annual 10K report which requires the disclosure of certain key elements.'

chapeau: |-
  In July 2011, I wrote the following in the COTE 100 Financial Letter:

  "Sino-Forest, the largest pulp and paper company in Canada, made headlines after a Hong Kong analyst published a report alleging that the company had committed several accounting irregularities, in particular by overvaluing the value of its woodlands as well as by carrying out transactions between its subsidiaries to boost sales. The future will tell us if the analyst was right to worry, but the shareholders didn’t wait for the independent report commissioned by the company's board of directors, as the stock fell more than 80% compared to its peak of the last 52 weeks reached last February… Even if no investor is safe from fraud, these latest events remind us too well that China is far from North American standards in terms of compliance, verification and transparency."

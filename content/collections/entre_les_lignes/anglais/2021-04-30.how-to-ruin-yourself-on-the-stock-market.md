        text: 'If you cannot lose on purpose, or at the very least significantly increase your chances of losing at a game, it is because chance plays a predominant role. This is particularly the case with games such as roulette, lottery, dice, etc. At these games you cannot lose on purpose.'

        text: "Most other games have some mixture of luck and skill. The mix varies between games, with some being largely unlucky - I would put chess, billiards, or tennis, for example, in this camp. Others, like the stock market, are probably as much luck as they are skill – it's probably this happy mix that makes it so popular with speculators during times like this."

        text: 'There is, however, an important caveat: if luck plays a very important role in the movements of the stock market and short-term securities, its place becomes less and less predominant with time and the accumulation of years. Thus, one may be lucky for a while on the stock market, but the one who succeeds for years and decades will not have been lucky; his success will have been based on his competence.'

        text: 'In my opinion, we can knowingly lose on the stock market, if not in the short term, then at least in the long term. Like Charlie Munger who recommends that we always “use inversion”, here is what I would do to put all the “chances” on my side of losing all my stock market holdings over the next 10 or 20 years:'

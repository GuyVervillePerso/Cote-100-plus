        text: 'Here’s a little conversation between my two friends, Mr. Bull, eternal optimist, and Mr. Bear, eternal pessimist, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that we are currently going through. Which camp would you place yourself in?'

        text: 'Mr. Bull: Stock markets corrected sharply in March after it was confirmed that COVID-19 was a global pandemic. But with the muscular and rapid reaction of our governments, it’s not surprising that the stock markets rebounded strongly. For investors, it soon became apparent that the US Federal Reserve and Western governments would do anything to help businesses and individuals weather this crisis.'

        text: 'Mr. Bear: True, but you cannot necessarily solve a global health crisis with billions of dollars. The only way to deal with this is to confine yourself to the home and wait for an effective medication or vaccine. However, experts all agree that it’ll take several months before this happens. The most optimistic speak of a minimum of 12 to 18 months. And if governments acted quickly to support businesses and individuals from the start of the pandemic, they cannot continue like this for months and months. There are limits to debt.'

        text: 'Mr. Bull: Anyway, deconfinement has already started. Businesses are gradually reopening and people are starting to go out and spend again. They are tired of staying at home and are only waiting for the moment when they can eat at the restaurant and return to the stores. The economic trough will be seen in the second quarter of 2020 and a recovery will materialize in the fall.'

        text: "Mr. Bear: Maybe. However, I believe it’s only a part of the population who thinks like that. Many people are afraid of getting the virus. Just because stores or restaurants are open doesn't mean they’ll visit them. Before that happens, they’ll have to feel safe. And forget about travel! Before people start traveling and flying again ... or going to concerts ... we’ll need an effective vaccine. Even a 12- to 18-month schedule seems very optimistic for many specialists. I recently read that the past record for developing a brand-new vaccine was four years ..."

        text: 'Mr. Bull: I’m confident that we’ll have a vaccine in 2021. The scientific world has never been so strongly mobilized towards such an important objective. Anyway, I personally believe that a vaccine is not the only solution. Drugs that are effective against the virus are likely to be developed and marketed long before a vaccine is released. A drug or cocktail of drugs that reduces the effect of the virus would have a large and rapid positive impact on our economy.'

        text: 'In any case, the stock market must be valued based on current interest rates. The rates essentially represent the cost of money. And as long as they stay as low as they are now, the alternatives to the stock market are much less attractive. We only have to look at the average dividend rate of the stocks that make up the S&P 500 index. It’s currently close to 2.05%, which is much more attractive than the rate of 0.62% for a 10-year government bond (or Canadian: 0.55%). Under such conditions, stock market securities deserve significantly higher valuation ratios than what we’ve seen historically. For example, if we apply a price-earnings ratio of, say, 18.0 to the expected profits of S&P 500 companies in 2021, a likely year of strong economic recovery, we can conclude that the stock market is not expensive right now.'

        text: 'Mr. Bear: Perhaps, but such an assessment is based on the optimistic scenario that the economy will recover for the better in 2021 and that corporate profits will rebound strongly. This is one of the possible scenarios, but there are a multitude of others just as likely. We could just as well foresee a scenario where a strong economic slowdown will last longer than expected and that any recovery will be very slow. If corporate profits are expected to decline in 2021, which is plausible given the current unemployment rate which is expected to continue to rise, limited resources of governments due to their high debt levels, the fact that consumers will not regain confidence until an effective vaccine or drug is developed, produced and distributed to the entire population, the economy will not rebound anytime soon and stock markets will still appear expensive.'

        text: 'Mr. Bull: I have confidence in the ability of companies to adapt to the current situation. I am also confident that the North American economy will rebound from the bottom that we’ll likely witness in the second quarter of 2020. We must also remember that billions of dollars have beeninvested by businesses, governments, foundations around the world to develop drugs, more effective screening tests and ultimately a vaccine. Necessity is the mother of invention.'

        text: 'Personally, I find it difficult to prove that either Mr. Bull or Mr. Bear is wrong. Both are right. The truth is that no one can predict with confidence what will happen in the months to come. However, I remain confident that the long-term, five- or ten-year outlook remains attractive forthe economy and for equity investors. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint or a series of sprints. If Mr. Bear regularly wins sprints, Mr. Bull invariably wins marathons.'
chapeau: 'I’ve noticed one thing over the years; whether they are optimists or pessimists, people tend to stick to their opinions. There is a psychological bias called the confirmation bias, according to which we tend to pay attention and retain only the information that confirms our preconceived ideas. That’s why changing one’s mind is often impossible.'

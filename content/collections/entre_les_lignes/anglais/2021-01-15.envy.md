        text: 'Yet envy is very common among investors, especially in bull markets. I suspect that this is in large part the source of the speculative bubbles that regularly boost certain sectors of the markets, sometimes even all of the stock markets.'

        text: "Your brother-in-law bought a bitcoin a few months ago for around $5,000 and he just called you to boast that it’s now worth over $35,000. He wonders whether he’ll buy himself a new boat with this bitcoin. Then there's your office mate who bought Tesla shares in March 2020 at almost $90 a share when the stock is now worth almost $835 — he has multiplied his money almost 10 times in less than a year and now he's thinking about selling his shares to buy the company's new model, a Tesla Model Y for his birthday."

        text: 'And then there''s your neighbour who, since working from home due to the pandemic, decided to open a brokerage account for a little fun. When you ran into him on the street a few days ago, he said it had been the best decision of his life and that he was seriously considering giving up his job to devote himself entirely to "managing" his portfolio. As it happens, just yesterday, he tells you, “I made a profit of $25,000 buying short-term call options on Zoom stock. It’s so easy! I should have gotten into it a long time ago!".'

        text: "On your side, you’ve never deviated from your investment strategy and your retirement plan. You continue to put money aside with every payday, money that is consistently reinvested in a mix of large North American corporate stocks (75%) and bonds (25%). This method has served you well over the years and you have had good returns for the past twenty or so years. But doubt grips you and you wonder if you could not go a little faster than the 8% return you recorded in 2020. You ask yourself ‟Couldn't I too take advantage of this windfall and buy the stock from Tesla, Microsoft or Zoom?”\_Isn't it frustrating to see your neighbour and your brother-in-law, who you think don't know much about the stock market and investing, outdo you in this way? Are you not also entitled to this new Tesla Model Y? How would you like to quit that ‟job” that forces you to sit at home attending Zoom conferences all day long?"

        text: "The envy of others' success brings us nothing more than frustration and hate. Make sure it doesn't lead to any serious mistakes that could cost you a large chunk of your retirement funds. In fact, it seems to me that I could very well have written this same blog in the late 1990s when many investors were drawn to dot-com stocks."
chapeau: 'Envy is one of the seven deadly sins. However, unlike most other sins, envy does not bring pleasure at all. On the contrary, it’s a source of frustration and hatred. What do you gain by envying the success of your neighbour?'

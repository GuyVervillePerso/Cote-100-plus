I am sure that, like me, you have made such mistakes. You probably have stocks in your portfolio that bring such errors back to mind.'

These are mainly the stocks that we saw pass by, that we looked at and analyzed, opted not to buy, and which subsequently appreciated significantly.'

        text: 'One of the costly mistakes I made in the management of our managed portfolios concerned Chipotle (“CMG”). Most of you are probably familiar with this fast-casual restaurant chain that has been very successful in the United States for many years. In this case, I find that my error was even worse than a simple error of omission – it combines errors of commission and omission!'

        text: 'In late 2015, illnesses linked to E. coli bacteria broke out among customers at several Chipotle restaurants. These incidents caused Chipotle’s stock to fall, but also had a very negative impact on its financial results in 2016 and 2017. However, at the end of 2017, we were alerted by the significant drop in the stock, which was then worth less than $300 from its peak of over $700 before the E. coli incidents. So, we took a close look at the company and bought the stock in November 2017 and February 2018 in one of our funds at an average price below $280 per share.'

In general, companies operating in the food industries (both food manufacturing and retail), service, transportation, manufacturing, financial services (banking, insurance and transaction processing), medical industries (services and instruments), retail (physical and online), utilities (electricity production and distribution), etc. We also invest in the technology sector, but we typically do so through companies providing services or selling software. In our view, these companies have significantly less risky business models and generally enjoy highly recurring revenues, which we are much more comfortable with.'

At the same time, I believe that every investor has a duty to quietly expand their sphere of expertise over the years by learning a little more about companies and industries. For example, we added the rail sector in recent years and are investing in Canadian National.'

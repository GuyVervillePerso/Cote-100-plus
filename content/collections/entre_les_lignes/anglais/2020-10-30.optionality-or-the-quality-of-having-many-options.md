        text: 'If an investment decision necessarily leads you to only one option, that decision doesn’t have optionality. The best decisions open many doors - they have great optionality and are usually the ones that create the most value. In the investment world, these are also decisions that lead to the best results.'

        text: 'I’ve always believed that as much as possible decisions should be made that increase optionality. This is true in life as it is in investing. For example, a student who is wondering what field to study during a bachelor’s degree should consider the optionality of the decision. If unsure of the field in which to study, in my opinion, the one to choose should be the one which will give the greatest "optionality", the one which opens the most doors for a future career or for a possible master''s degree.'

        text: 'This is also true for the entrepreneur who is trying to develop a new product. On the one hand, he wants to focus his efforts on a single product aimed at a niche market. At the same time, he’ll want the features he adds to this product to open up a larger market for him, or even allow him to access related markets.'

        text: 'In stock investing, I see it the same way, but the reasoning is a little different. In my opinion, we must try to find the company stocks that offer the greatest optionality. But in this case, the optionality belongs to the company and not to the investor, although the investor could well benefit greatly if the company makes the right investment decisions in the future.'

        text: "On the one hand, we should focus on companies that are active in growth sectors and offer attractive long-term growth opportunities. Maybe it's because their industry is naturally growing. Or maybe it's because a company has the opportunity to grow by acquisition in a fragmented industry. Investors who panned on Couche-Tard stock 20 years ago may have underestimated the value of the company's optionality, especially the possibility that it would make acquisitions that could create value for its shareholders in a sector which is nevertheless showing modest growth. We mustn’t forget another source of optionality for Couche-Tard: its network of convenience stores, which focuses above all on proximity to consumers, is able to offer a wide range of products and services. On the other hand, we shouldn’t invest in companies whose sector is in decline or which could eventually disappear."

        text: 'Furthermore, I try to favour two other factors that create optionality for a business, which I believe are largely overlooked by investors: a very strong balance sheet and the ability to generate significant free cash flow. While so many investors focus their attention on growing corporate income and profits, they simply ignore the balance sheet and free cash flow.'

        text: 'A company that’s in excellent financial health has significantly more options for creating shareholder value than one that makes full use of debt to fund its operations. A company with a lot of cash on hand and little debt can afford to consider all kinds of alternative options that are not generally available to other companies: buy back its own shares, pay a special dividend, make an acquisition, or invest more in its own activities in order to boost its long-term growth.'

        text: 'The same goes for a business that generates substantial free cash flow. Such a company also enjoys great "optionality" since it can use the free cash flow to create as much value as possible for its shareholders.'

        text: 'Ideally, you can find companies that have all three of these factors: a good industry that offers long-term growth opportunities, a great balance sheet, and the ability to generate significant free cash flow. That’s a good way for the investor to profit from the "optionality".'
chapeau: 'The term "optionality" represents the value of investment options that arise after making an initial investment. In the investment world, personal or corporate optionality is the sum of the values of all the options created by a decision.'

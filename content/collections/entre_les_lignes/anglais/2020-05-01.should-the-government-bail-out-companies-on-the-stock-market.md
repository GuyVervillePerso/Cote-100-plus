        text: 'I think there are some exceptions that deserve a government rescue. For example, the decision of the American government to come to the rescue of the big American banks during the 2008-2009 financial crisis was in my opinion the right decision. Their bankruptcy would have shaken the confidence of depositors, which is the very foundation of the entire financial system. Who knows what would have happened and how badly the economy would have collapsed if the US government had not helped the big banks during the 2008-2009 financial crisis?'

        text: "For investors, investing in a listed company has always been risky. The investor should keep in mind that the bankruptcy of some of its companies is a real possibility, especially in the event of a crisis or a severe economic slowdown. If investing in the stock market has historically provided attractive returns to investors, it’s precisely because the level of risk is higher. Some companies will go bankrupt; It's inevitable. In some cases it’ll be because their leaders have been too reckless; in others it’ll be due to factors largely beyond their control. The latter is the case with the current pandemic."

        text: "I don't understand, for example, why the US government should inject billions of dollars (it plans to inject some US$58 billion) into major American airlines. Isn't it common knowledge that this industry is particularly risky? The investor who invests in it must live with the risk that an airline company could go bankrupt and lose all of the investment. That the United States government wants to preserve the thousands of jobs in the airline industry is commendable, even desirable, but that it simultaneously protects the shareholders of these companies seems indecent to me."

        text: 'We could also take the example of Boeing, which until recently asked for the tidy sum of US$60 billion from the US government, for itself and for its numerous suppliers. Again, I believe the government should do everything to save Boeing and the North American aviation industry and its jobs, but it doesn’t have to fly to the rescue of Boeing shareholders or its suppliers. Especially since Boeing has bought back about US$40 billion of its own shares in the past 10 years or so.'

        text: "I would add that corporate bailouts are not very fair for companies that are left out, or for investors who had invested in the industry's least risky companies. When a company goes through the bankruptcy protection process, it’s either dismantled or liquidated, or it emerges considerably diminished. Its competitors generally take advantage of the situation to gain significant market share. They’ll also be able to charge more for their products or services. This is the law of the jungle and natural selection: the strongest companies end up leaving the weakest in the dust. If we systematically help the weakest companies, the strongest will not be able to stand out."

        text: 'In my opinion, a government must be very careful before helping a company in difficulty. It must do so if its bankruptcy risks causing great damage to the economy (this was the case in 2008-2009 of the failure of the big American banks considered "too big to fail"). It should also consider it when there are a lot of jobs at stake, but in no case should it seek to compensate the shareholders.'
chapeau: 'I think the important thing is to save jobs, not corporate shareholders. The bankruptcy protection law was created to allow businesses to continue operating while they negotiate with their creditors. The law is an essential cog in the capitalist system and it generally works very well.'

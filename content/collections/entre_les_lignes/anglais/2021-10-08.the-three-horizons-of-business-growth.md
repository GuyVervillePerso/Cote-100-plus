The EOS system is relatively simple and filled with “common sense”, but it has given us the tools to run our business better.'

At this level, leaders are trying to identify growth avenues that could whip up its growth over the next few years. Such opportunities will require potentially substantial investments, which could weigh on the company's profitability in the short term."

For example, investments in R & D over a horizon of several years. Often, it is precisely these projects that executives too concerned with maximizing short-term profits will eliminate because they reduce the short-term profits of the company while their future profits are distant and uncertain.'

        text: 'As part of our EOS system, three years ago we started by setting ambitious goals for 2030. Then, based on those goals, we set our corporate goals for three years, which then led to our goals for the next year. The setting of such objectives has forced us to not only think in terms of the elements to be improved over the next year (Horizon One), but also to think about the investments to be made in order to allow us to reach our objectives in the medium term (three years or Horizon Two). We also need to think about what seeds we will need to sow now if we are to achieve our long-term goals (10 years or Horizon Three). We repeat this exercise every year to measure our progress toward achieving our long-term goals and to set our goals for the next three- and one-year horizons.'

        text: 'As a long-term investor, I believe it is important to keep these three growth horizons in mind when assessing the prospects for companies in your portfolio as well as any potential new investments. Are the leaders of these companies working in parallel on projects belonging to the three horizons of growth or, as unfortunately is the case with too many companies, are they rather obsessed with their performance for the next quarter?'
chapeau: "Last week, my partners and I at COTE 100 spent three days “on retreat” (personally, I prefer the term “planning session” to that of “retreat”!) to discuss our company's growth strategy, plan its next fiscal year and establish our short-, medium- and longer-term goals. It is a demanding exercise, but very rewarding, that we have been repeating every year for the past three years."

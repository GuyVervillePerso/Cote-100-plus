        text: 'Over the past several weeks, my team and I have analyzed the stock of a Canadian company. After an analysis of the business model, risks, growth opportunities, etc., we concluded that the stock was a buy based on our assessment. But can we conclude that we are certain that such an investment will be lucrative in the next few years? Absolutely not! Many often-unpredictable factors could affect the company’s results and our assessment of its stock over the next few years.'

        text: '“Never” and “always” are also to be avoided. The same observation for “impossible”. Whatever sector you invest in, you cannot know the future. Competition is fierce in most industries and most of them will be disrupted by innovation in the years to come. This is especially true these days when technological developments are coming at breakneck speed.'

        text: 'In the same vein, we must be careful with analyses that evaluate a stock market to two decimal places. How can someone claim that Couche-Tard stock is worth $71.36? The valuation of a company cannot be precise. The exercise involves estimation, educated guesses.'

        text: 'Also watch out for definitive expressions such as “company XYZ has an unassailable business model”. Such a sentence, in my opinion, poses two problems. On the one hand, one cannot say that a business model is unassailable; we should rather say, “difficult to attack”. On the other hand, by writing such a sentence, one expresses an opinion – one believes that the business model of the company is unassailable. In our publications, we try as much as possible to write “We believe that” or “in our opinion”.'

        text: 'The word “guaranteed”, as in “guaranteed return”, is also to be avoided. In fact, when talking about risky investments like stocks, the mention of “guaranteed returns” should ring alarm bells in any investor’s mind. Even among the “safer” investments of bonds, there are no guarantees or guaranteed returns. You only have to look at what were North American bond yields in 2022 to be convinced.'

  In my opinion, certain words should be erased from the investor’s vocabulary.

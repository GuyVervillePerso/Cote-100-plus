To make it easier, I will continue to use the example of a company that I’ve closely looked over in the past few weeks and which I think has an excellent overall rating for the quality of its management team.'

                text: "The vision and the strategy. From the outside, as an investor, it’s difficult to measure and qualify the validity of a company's strategy. In my opinion, the most important point is to ensure that management’s strategy and vision remain consistent over the years. We want to avoid “weather vanes” that change their direction according to the new flavour of the month. So, for me, the role of a management team is not only to establish the strategy of the company they manage, but above all to execute it and communicate it clearly by constantly repeating it."

        text: "The strategy of the company that I have analyzed is to develop a global network to serve its customers around the world with an unequaled and very personalized level of service. To do this, management has for decades relied on the development of a network of independent branches run by local people who speak the language and who understand the cultural particularities of their customers. At the same time, the branch network is united by an efficient technological platform which ensures consistency and standardization of the services offered to all of the company's customers. These technological systems also make it possible to obtain significant economies of scale for all of the company's activities."

Interestingly enough, we thought the same thing in 1979 when the company was founded, and we still believe that today. Consequently, each year we invest significant resources to enhance our core logistics platform and to develop new systems, it is part of our DNA."'

We are looking for leaders who are ready to act independently of Wall Street and its analysts who are essentially asking them to deliver good profits in the next quarter. Again, it's hard to measure to what degree a leader thinks in the long term, but you can get an idea of it by reading his annual letters to shareholders and listening to his quarterly conference calls."

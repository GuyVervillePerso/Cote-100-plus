        text: 'From the outset, it is not so easy to go back. If you had a portfolio 30 years ago, it’s a good bet that many of the companies in the portfolio from that time disappeared afterwards, either the company was bought (takeover) or the company went bankrupt. In both cases, it becomes difficult to go back in time to obtain precise data.'

        text: "However, I have taken the first steps to go back in time using the example of the portfolio of the COTE\_100 Financial Bulletin, which has existed since 1988. First, I used the Canadian portfolio of the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin as of December 31, 2012. The reason is that it significantly simplifies the exercise. I also believe this is a good sampling that gives a good idea of what the portfolio would have been doing for 10 years."

In such a case, we have assumed that the proceeds from the sale of the security will have been reinvested in the same month in the remaining securities in the portfolio according to the weightings of each security at that precise moment.'

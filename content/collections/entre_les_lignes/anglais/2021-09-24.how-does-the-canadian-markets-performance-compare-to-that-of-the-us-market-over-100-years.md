        text: "Indeed, since 2010, the US stock market has outrageously dominated the Canadian market. From January 1, 2010 to present, the S&P 500 Total (including dividends) recorded an annual compound return of 14.47% compared to 7.80% for the S&P/TSX Total (including dividends) for the same period. In my opinion, this is the reason why, when I talk to investors, most of them say they prefer US stocks. S.A.'s question appears to make the same presumption."

For the S&P 500, the dividend yield has averaged 3.75% since 1927, bringing the total index return to nearly 9.80%. I have not been able to find the equivalent data for the Canadian index, but I suspect that it is similar to that of the market American (if not a little higher, due to the heavy weighting of banks in the index). One might estimate that the annual compound total return of the Canadian market since 1927 has been close to 8.9%. Either way, these returns are attractive and would have been even higher had it not been for the Great Depression of the 1930s.'

I would like to know, if we take all the Canadian securities over a 100-year period, what the graph would be. I think it wouldn't be as nice. Does it exist?”"

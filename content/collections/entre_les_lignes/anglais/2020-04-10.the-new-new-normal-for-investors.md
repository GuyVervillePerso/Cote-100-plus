        text: 'However, I believe we can expect the pandemic to upset the status quo over the next many years. We have already seen that governments are ready to do everything to ensure that the economy is not too affected by the severe restrictive measures imposed around the world to counter the ravages of the pandemic. They’ll do anything to help businesses and consumers get through the weeks to come. If they have learned one thing from the 2008-2009 financial crisis, it’s that it’s better to intervene quickly and forcefully in order to allow the economic system to continue operating almost normally. If the economy is to recover from the pandemic, businesses and consumers must above all survive financially.'

        text: 'Government investments and bailouts are calculated in multiples of trillions of $. It’s the right thing to do in my opinion, but someone will one day have to pay for the substantial debt that will result from this crisis. Who will do it and how?'

        text: 'I see two options. The first would be to significantly raise taxes on businesses and individuals, while cutting government spending. However, I believe that this option’s limited and that it wouldn’t work very well politically.'

        text: 'The second is, in my opinion, the most plausible: the central banks will continue to print money and buy the debt that has been issued by governments. The likely result will be an increase in the rate of inflation over the next many years. Only an increase in inflation will likely reduce the huge debt burden that will result from the pandemic.'

        text: 'In my opinion, he should favour the types of investments that can protect him from the coming inflation: stocks of companies on the stock exchange, real estate and gold. Among these three asset classes, I prefer the first two since they provide an income, unlike gold.'

        text: 'If we favour stocks of companies, I would add that it’ll be better to choose companies that’ll be able to offset the cost increases to come by price increases for their products or services. Firms that have the ability to raise the price of their products through relatively constant demand will be better placed to counter inflation.'

        text: 'My crystal ball is cloudy, especially now. However, such a new "new normal" seems to me to be a very plausible scenario for the years to come.'
chapeau: 'In the years following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, many observers adopted the phrase "New Normal" to describe what happened economically. In the years following this crisis, the economic recovery had been long and slow, unlike the recoveries that have typically followed recessions in recent decades. The new normal has thus been characterized by weak economic growth, very low interest rates compared to the last decades, a historically high rate of government debt, low inflation and almost full employment in many western countries. We could have continued on this path for a long time, if the new coronavirus had not made its appearance.'

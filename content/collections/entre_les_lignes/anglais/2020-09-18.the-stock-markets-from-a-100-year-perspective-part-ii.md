        text: 'Many observers today believe that we are now at the heart of a technological revolution unprecedented in history. However, according to the authors, that’s all wrong. To support their position, they quote a Financial Times article from January 13, 2001: “… the notion that information technology represents the greatest transformation since the Industrial Revolution is historically illiterate. The technological changes between 1880 and 1940 exceeded, in both scope and intensity, all that has happened since."'

        text: 'According to the authors, the industrial revolution brought new sources of energy (electricity, oil and gas), new modes of transport (motor vehicles and airplanes), new industries (automobile and pharmaceutical), new media and news, new ways of communicating (telephone and radio), new products (household appliances, mass consumption products, antibiotics) and new entertainment products (cinema and television). These major changes had a profound impact on the industry composition of stock markets during the 20th century. Here are the relative weights of some industries in the US stock market at the end of 1899 and 2000. The selected industrial sectors are those that existed in 1900:'

        text: "I would highlight just two of the major changes over the century. On the one hand, the fall in the importance of railways, whose weight in the market fell from 62.8% to 0.2%. Furthermore, the authors estimated that if they had included the various companies providing products and services to rail carriers, the industry's share would have been over 70%. After more than 100 years of development, America's rail network was pretty much fully completed by the turn of the 20th century. But while competition was almost non-existent in 1900, it rapidly increased in the decades that followed, with the development of automobiles decimating demand for passenger rail transport and that of trucks replacing much of the demand for freight transport."

chapeau: 'In my previous blog, I presented two changes observed by the authors of the book "The Triumph of the Optimists" in the world stock markets from 1900 to 2000. The first observed change is in the relative size of the stock markets of various countries. Thus, we saw in particular that the United States had achieved a position of world leadership at the start of the 20th century and that its domination increased throughout the century. At the end of 2000, according to the authors, the US Stock Exchange accounted for nearly half of the value of publicly traded companies in the world. The second change was the divergence in the evolution of the US and UK stock markets over the century. Political and economic power clearly shifted from the British Empire to the United States over the century, which was reflected in the respective performance of the two exchanges.'

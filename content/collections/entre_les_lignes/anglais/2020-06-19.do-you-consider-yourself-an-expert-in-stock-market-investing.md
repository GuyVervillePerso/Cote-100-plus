        text: 'Over the years and at the many tournaments that I’ve participated in, I’ve seen a recurring phenomenon. The players who take themselves seriously the most, those who have the most expensive and latest equipment and who display an arrogant and confident attitude, are often players of a relatively low level. On the other hand, those who are humble and don’t take themselves too seriously are often experienced and high-level players. This is a warning: watch out for players who seem like nothing!'

        text: 'If you look at the graph above, you can see that beginners in any field tend to overestimate their skill level. Their level of confidence even rivals that of the experts! At this point, the tennis player could quickly fall back to earth as soon as he has to compete with an experienced opponent (I myself have experienced this phenomenon many times over the years!).'

        text: 'But after crossing the “Mountain of Stupidity”, the tennis player quickly realizes that the practice of the sport is much more complex than he originally thought. The tennis player may progress continuously but there will always be more talented and more experienced opponents. In the “Valley of Despair”, he or she realizes how tennis is a multifaceted sport and how much will have to learned and developed on many fronts (technical, strategic, physical and psychological) before reaching a real level of expertise.'

        text: 'The analogy certainly exists in the area of stock market investment. Beginner traders commonly believe that they are knowledgeable in the field when they know essentially nothing. For beginners, annual returns of 25% or 30% seem realistic. Often, they believe that they’ve found a unique method that will allow them to get rich quickly.'

chapeau: 'Warning! Your answer could say a lot about your actual skill level. The following graph (Rawpixel) shows the Dunning-Kruger effect, also called the overconfidence effect. The phenomenon was discovered from a series of experiments by American psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the results of which were published in 1999.'

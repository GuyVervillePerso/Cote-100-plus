        text: "However, I believe that valuation is always capital in investment, at least in the medium and long terms. As we commonly say, “everything has a price” and the price paid for everything is fundamental. If I made you an offer of $200,000 for your home, you'd probably reject it without considering it for more than two seconds – you're not a seller, after all. But if I come back to see you the next day with a $2 million offer, you're more likely to listen to me, right?"

        text: 'All the work of a financial analyst or investor relies on their ability to value a business. He must measure many aspects of that business and use that analysis to come up with a reasonable valuation. If all is well and the outlook is favourable, he will give a higher rating. If, on the contrary, the outlook is less favourable and the risks are higher, he will give it a mediocre assessment.'

        text: 'And what about the risks? In the insurance industry, for example, you will always find an insurer to cover any kind of risk. The riskier and more unusual (non-standard) a coverage, the higher will be the insurance premium. The insurer does sort of the same job as the financial analyst – he assigns a price, a valuation, to the risk involved.'

It is when a group of investors believe that the valuation of a security or a sector is unimportant that we find the extremes of valuations that we saw during the tech bubble of the late 1990s.'

Isn't that what happened during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when many investors panicked and decided to sell at all costs?"

The analysis, in addition to being very well done, explained the reasons for the drop in the stock. However, it was the conclusion that startled me: “As a result, it doesn’t matter what company X’s valuation is at this stage, since its fate is in the hand of regulators...”'

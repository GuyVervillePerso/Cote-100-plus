        text: 'The death of Charlie Munger this week at the age of 99 took me a bit by surprise. At such an advanced age, it was to be expected, but Munger has been part of my investing life for so long, he has served as a beacon for me for so long that I can’t believe I won’t be able to listen to him next May at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting.'

        text: '3- Rationalism. Always the reverse. Munger often joked that all he wanted to know was where he would die so he would never set foot there. To solve problems, Munger always advocated the practice of “inverting” a problem: instead of thinking about hitting home runs, it is better to find the best way to strike out as infrequently as possible.'

        text: "5- Thirst to learn.\_His children called him “a book on legs” because he always had a book in his hand and took advantage of any break to read. He was particularly fond of biographies to learn from the successes and failures of others. He often said that learning every day was a moral duty."

One of the first investments advocating the quality of a company rather than a low valuation was See’s Candies in 1972 for US$25 million."

He attempted throughout his life to learn and add arrows to his quiver of knowledge, which added to his latticework of tools helping him make better decisions. He never believed in specialization, but always advocated for a broad and diverse education."

But even if he will no longer be able to speak and write to us, Munger will remain, through his writings and his messages, a model to follow, a mentor, for current investors and for those of future generations. His star already shines among the greatest in the business and investment world and among people who have done much good for countless people around the world.'

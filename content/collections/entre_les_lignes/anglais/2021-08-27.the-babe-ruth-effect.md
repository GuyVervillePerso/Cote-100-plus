Should this manager be considered an investment icon if only 34% of the stocks he selects appreciate? It is difficult to answer this question without having more information about the portfolio.'

        text: "Despite a significantly lower batting average, Portfolio B outperformed Portfolio A, yielding 8.5% versus 5.6%. The 54% loss on one of the securities in Portfolio A somewhat mitigated the gains made on the others. In portfolio B, the 195% gain was enough to erase the losses of the others. Again, the frequency of success does not matter; it's the scale of success that matters."

        text: "That being said, an investor shouldn't just try to find the riskiest situations that allow him to land multiple home runs. Risk management remains important. A single large increase cannot compensate for several large losses. However, by carefully selecting securities, an investor can ensure that downside risk is limited by trying to avoid large declines while still managing to occasionally hit a home run. These occasional significant successes will have a decisive impact on the performance of a portfolio. In addition, the effect will be amplified if the portfolio is concentrated. It is for this reason that our portfolios at COTE 100 are relatively concentrated, holding only 20 to 30 securities."

However, it's important to remember that over the long term, stocks that appreciate well will more than make up for declines in some others. Coming to bat, Babe Ruth knew from the start that he couldn't get a hit every time."

  Babe Ruth is recognized as one of the best hitters in Major League Baseball history with a batting average of 0.342. Specifically, Babe Ruth was successful in getting at least a base hit 34.2 percent of the time at bat. Even more impressive, 8.5% of his at-bat appearances turned into a home run. With his average of 0.342, Babe Ruth is without a doubt a baseball icon.

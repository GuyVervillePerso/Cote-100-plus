        text: 'Thus, few companies can afford to compare themselves only to their local competition. Sooner or later, if they aren’t already doing it, they risk facing international competition and finding it tough. To be successful in the long term, one must aim at the national, even international, level. This is the reality today in a growing number of areas.'

        text: "The fact remains that companies that manage to climb to the national or international level will see a market with great potential open up before them. If the hill is tough to climb, the potential will be enormous for those who succeed. It's the same for a student or a tennis player."

        text: 'Like everyone else, I followed the American presidential campaign. If there’s one arena where competition is fierce, it’s such an election. However, it seems to me that this campaign, as well as previous ones, shows the least glowing aspect of a competition - a game where the rules of decorum and fair play are constantly flouted. Presidential candidates can say just about anything to get them up in the polls and win the election. No one is shy about launching personal attacks against the other candidate or their party. If such practices can win an election, I wonder, frankly, if they serve democracy well in the long run.'

        text: 'I also feel that too many companies are overstepping fair play in the name of competition, market share gains and profit growth. For example, the allegations of anti-competitive practices on the part of large American technology companies by various Western governments make me question the fair play of these companies. And what about companies that take advantage of the fact that their stock is shunned by investors and privatize?'

        text: 'For my part, the many tennis tournaments I’ve participated in over the past forty years or so have made me a fierce competitor. I hate to lose and will do anything to win every time I step onto a tennis court. At the same time, I’ve developed too much respect for the sport to engage in dishonest practices like "stealing" points or knowingly disturbing my opponent. However, I can assure you that there are many competitors who engage in such practices. My experience has shown me time and time again that unethical actions can win games, but they do more harm than good in the long run. In the world of tennis as in all areas, unethical people quickly build a bad reputation that will follow them for a long time. As Warren Buffett has often said, '

        text: 'I’d like to again refer to Warren Buffett, an investor and manager with an unblemished reputation who has often repeated that in business it’s better to take “the high road" because it’s generally less busy! He’s one of the few people who reiterates that honest and ethical behaviour pays the best in the long run because it sets us apart from most of the competition.'

        text: 'It seems to me that our businesses and the young people of the next generation should take this advice. Obviously, as an investor, I want to invest in companies whose leaders are very competitive and whose long-term goals are very ambitious. But at the same time, I want to make sure that they will always take the ethical route. To me, the ideal leader is both a great competitor and a highly ethical person.'
chapeau: "Anyone who wants to be successful in life, in my opinion, must have a real competitive streak. Whether it's the student in the classroom, the tennis player who competes in provincial tournaments, the employee of a company who aims to advance in his career, the level of competition is getting higher and higher. I’d even say it’ll only increase over the next few years. It’s become a cliché to say it, but the planet is a village and competition has become global in almost every area of business."

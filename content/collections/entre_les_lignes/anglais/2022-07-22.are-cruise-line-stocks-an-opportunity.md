The company’s earnings are currently depressed due to the pandemic, but we believe it should return to profitability in the coming quarters.'

        text: 'In 2019, its best year ever, Carnival generated operating profits (EBITDA) of US$5.5 billion. If it succeeded in repeating this performance, Carnival would have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.0. In other words, if it allocated all of its profits to this purpose, it would not be able to pay off all of its debt for at least five years. This assumption does not even consider the interest to be paid. In simpler terms, Carnival’s level of debt is very high.'

        text: 'A high debt level leads to various problems for a company. First, it hinders growth. For example, heavily indebted companies can hardly invest in advertising or research and development. Moreover, growth through acquisitions is probably not a possible strategy in their case. Indebted companies therefore have little flexibility; they mainly manage their costs and not growth.'

In the case of Carnival, it will have to pay nearly US$1.6 billion in interest annually. Imagine having full credit cards and paying high interest; it then becomes very difficult to get out of it since most of one’s cash is directed towards debts.'

        text: 'A debt-laden company also has little room to manoeuvre in the event of an interest rate hike. The recent rate hike affects Carnival since part of its debt is at variable rates. In addition to paying more interest, it will have to refinance at even higher rates. Carnival’s most recent debt was issued at a rate of 10.5%.'

        text: 'In a situation where debt financing becomes difficult, a heavily indebted company could be forced to issue shares at a low price. This appears to be the case with Carnival, which just announced the issuance of 117 million shares at a price of $9.95 per share. Such an issue is problematic for existing investors since it dilutes their ownership by almost 10%. Dilution reduces each shareholder’s slice of the pie.'

In Canada, the bankruptcy of Air Canada (AC) in 2003 is another good example. Despite their bankruptcy, these companies still exist.'

  By Jean-Philippe Legault, guest contributor

  I recently had a very interesting discussion with one of our clients about the cruise ship industry. He told me that the securities of Carnival (CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) had corrected quite a bit recently. Their stock prices are approaching their previous lows made at the start of the pandemic in March 2020. He wanted to know my opinion about the sector.

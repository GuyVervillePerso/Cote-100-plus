However, the majority of players who do not reach this level will have difficulty self-financing their career. When should a player whose ranking is near the top\_100 conclude that he has come to the end of his journey and that a career change is in order?"

I know, for example, that many investors place stop-loss orders for the stocks they hold in their portfolio. Others will set themselves the goal of selling a stock that has done nothing for two or three years.'

        text: 'The first is Stantec. We acquired our first shares of this Canadian engineering services company in early 2015 for approximately $32 per share. However, in October 2019, more than four and a half years later, the stock was only worth $28. A policy of selling a stock that did not deliver the goods after two or three years would undoubtedly have forced us to sell the stock. It would have been a costly mistake: from the end of 2019, the stock began a strong rise which took it to more than $110 today. Despite its very slow start out of the blocks, the stock has given us a compound annual return of nearly 14.7% since our initial purchase, without considering dividends received during the period.'

        text: 'The other example is Cencora, which was called AmerisourceBergen when we initially purchased the stock in late 2017 for around $82. The company is a distributor of pharmaceutical and medical products in North America. As of early 2020, more than two years later, the stock was still worth around $82. Was this a good reason to sell it? Obviously, no: its price today is almost $238. Without considering dividends, the stock gave us a compound annual return of around 36%.'

        text: 'For example, in 2017, we wrote into our buy scenario for AmerisourceBergen that we believed its stock valuation was depressed due to concerns that Amazon would become a strong competitor in medical distribution. We also concluded that the market for drugs and medical products would be difficult to sell directly to consumers. Had this scenario changed two years later, even if its stock was floundering? No. And the company’s profits continued to increase during the period.'

        text: 'In short, I believe that it is healthy and productive to question one’s portfolio stocks regularly, especially those that have not delivered the expected goods. But selling automatically is a mistake that could prove costly. When a stock stalls on the stock market for a while, I recommend patience, as long as the reasons that motivated our initial purchase are valid.'

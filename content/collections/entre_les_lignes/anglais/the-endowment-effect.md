title: 'The Endowment Effect'
chapeau: 'In the 1990s, Ziv Carmon and Dan Ariely conducted a statistical study with students from Duke University in the United States. They managed to reach 93 students who were on a waiting list to buy tickets for a semi-final game of the NCAA Basketball Tournament. They asked them two questions.'

        text: 'What do you think the results were? Before presenting them, it is important to note that basketball is a very popular sport at Duke, and this tournament is highly coveted. Excluding the most extreme cases, the students were willing to pay, on average, $166 for a ticket, while I estimate that its sale price was about $45 at that time. On the other hand, if they already had a ticket, the students would only be willing to sell it, on average, for $2,411.'

I recently saw a stock portfolio worth $600,000 in which 35% ($210,000) was invested in a single stock, that of the investor’s employer. Regardless of tax considerations, this investor was reluctant to sell part of his shares because he believed that the stock would continue to perform well.'

His answer: “Of course not!” This investor was biased by the endowment effect: he valued more highly an asset he already owned.'

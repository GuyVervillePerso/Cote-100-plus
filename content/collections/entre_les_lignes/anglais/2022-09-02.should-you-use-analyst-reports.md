I don’t believe these reports are a substitute for thorough research, but they are a step in the right direction. These reports often summarize the situation well and save the investor time.'

First, I have the impression that analysts often adjust their target price according to the stock price. Without naming the company and the analyst, here is a concrete example of what I see happen too often with target prices:'

In the third quarter of 2020, he changes its model and uses a valuation based on revenue (9 times revenue). The following quarter, he uses operating profits again (22 times EBITDA). I could be wrong, but I feel like this adjustment is made to adjust to the price of the stock.'

At that time, 55% of recommendations were buys while only 7% were sell recommendations. The others recommended holding the stock. However, at that time, our investment team had difficulty finding interesting opportunities.'

Companies wishing to issue equity or debt will often lean towards banks that issue favourable reports on their stock. I guess it must be difficult to get the mandate to issue shares when the in-house analyst recommends the sale of the stock.'

I therefore suggest that you take advantage of the work of analysts to understand, validate and question your own investment thesis. For the evaluation of a stock and the final recommendation, pass over it quickly and form your own opinion.'

  With the advancement of technology and improved brokerage platforms, most investors now have access to multiple research reports. These reports allow you to obtain the opinion of analysts about a stock on the market. Recommendations vary between buying, holding, or selling the security in question.

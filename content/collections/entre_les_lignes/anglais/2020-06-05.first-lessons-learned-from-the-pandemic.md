        text: 'A crisis can occur at any time and often when you least expect it. Who could have predicted last January that the world would face a virus that would infect millions of people and cause hundreds of thousands of victims? That the pandemic would put some 45 million Americans out of work? In fact, in the long term, crises are inevitable. They are part of an investor’s life.'

        text: 'Once this reality is accepted, an investor should adjust the way to invest to be protected as much as possible from an eventual crisis. Indeed, if it’s only a matter of time before a health, economic or financial crisis occurs, without notice, an investor should in my opinion ensure to have a portfolio that will be able to resist as best as possible.'

        text: 'This is why it’s important to favour companies that are in excellent financial health. Companies with more cash than debt found themselves in a strong position at the height of the pandemic crisis in March. For most of them, their survival has never really been in question. This was not the case for heavily indebted companies.'

        text: 'It’s true that a company that has substantial cash and no debt is disadvantaged when all is well. This cash reduces the return on capital and most likely lowers the return on the stock market when economic conditions are favourable. But it’s just the opposite in a financial crisis where cash becomes king.'

        text: 'A parenthesis is essential here: if a crisis can occur at any time, it doesn’t make sense for a long-term investor to invest on margin. Such a practice calls for disaster.'

        text: 'By "flexible business model" I mean a model that requires relatively little capital and mostly involves variable costs rather than fixed costs. For example, a company whose main asset is based on the expertise of its employees is able to adjust very quickly to a crisis such as the one we’re experiencing. If necessary, it can quickly adjust its cost structure. It can also change the way it works in order to adjust to the constraints of the crisis (telework, for example). On the other hand, companies whose business model is based on fixed costs and substantial fixed assets aren’t able to adjust as quickly. I’m thinking in particular of airlines, hotels, auto parts factories.'

        type: text
        text: 'Whatever the conditions, people need to eat. Companies offering non-discretionary services or products are better positioned than those whose products and services significantly depend on economic conditions. In fact, I’m comforted by our decision to avoid very cyclical sectors as much as possible, including the natural resources sector, in our portfolios under management.'

        text: 'I don’t believe that investors should hold only securities that meet these criteria in their portfolio; however, they should make room for them. In my opinion, this is what we’ve learned to date from the COVID-19 pandemic.'
chapeau: 'It’s possibly still too early to say what the pandemic will have taught investors. Indeed, even if the stock markets seem to indicate that it’s coming to an end, who knows how long it’ll last still and what its economic impacts will be for the quarters and years to come.'

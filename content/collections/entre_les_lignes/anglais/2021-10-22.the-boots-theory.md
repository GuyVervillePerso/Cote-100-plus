But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.'

A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots at the same time and would still have wet feet.\""

        text: 'Although my journey is much less literary, I have come to similar conclusions regarding investing in stocks on the stock market. In fact, Warren Buffett arrived at this conclusion long before me, having devoted the first years of his investing career to what he called “cigar butts”, those stocks which one can buy for very little and which still offer us some good puffs of smoke. After a few years and with the guidance of Charlie Munger, Buffett realized that it was much better to invest in high quality businesses at a reasonable price and hold onto them for many years – the equivalent of $50 boots.'

        text: 'Like the best boots, high-quality stocks bought at a reasonable price end up being much better investments over the years than a bunch of cigar butts or $10 boots. In addition, they keep your feet dry! This is because high quality companies typically cause much less stress as they will navigate tough economic times without too much trouble and continue to grow their profits and enrich their shareholders over the long term.'

chapeau: 'I had never heard of this theory before this summer, when we were reading as a family the draft of my book (which I continue to actively work on), when it came to the issue of the difficulty of saving.'

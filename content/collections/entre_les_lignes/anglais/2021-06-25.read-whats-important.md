        text: 'One of the concepts I learned from the book is that any information you can read about the stock markets and the investment world has an expiration date. This idea was put forward by Nick Sleep and Qais Zacharia, two iconoclastic investors who have had great success on the stock market. '

        text: 'Take the time to catalog what you read on a typical day. If you are like most investors, you will find that the vast majority of your reading is about fleeting information with a very short expiration date. In my opinion, this is the kind of information that populates most financial sites on the web. This is also largely what is published by financial newspapers and magazines. Readers have limited attention spans and the media serve them what is likely to grab their attention, even if only for a few minutes.'

This is the kind of information an investor should try to focus on in my opinion. It is this information that will make us better long-term investors. It teaches us new concepts that we can adopt and use for many years to come. It improves our general level of knowledge and makes us more knowledgeable and better prepared investors.'

Personally, I would also add most of the articles on economics, economic statistics, and especially economists' forecasts. Not only are these forecasts generally wrong, but often, they focus on the short term – the rate of inflation expected in the next quarter, the anticipated level of employment that will be announced next week, etc."

I obviously suggest you read the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letters written by Warren Buffett since 1965 (the Berkshire Hathaway website features letters dating back to 1977, but a book has been written that features all the letters from 1965 to 2014:'

It is better, for example, to buy the securities of quality companies, even if it means paying a little more. It is often also better to pay a little more for quality products that will last much longer. As we often heard many years ago in a French advertisement: “'

chapeau: 'I recently finished reading “Richer, Wiser, Happier” by William Green. In this book, which I rated four stars (★★★★), the author introduces us to several investors who have managed to outperform stock indices for long periods of time. He tells us about their investment philosophy, their particularities, and the factors specific to their success. This is another great read for the investor looking to improve.'

        text: "Without going into too much detail, the author had developed a “model” that told him that the stock markets would decline. His model was developed by comparing historical returns of the S&P\_500 with certain periods of the US presidential cycle. It also combined different economic measures that showed that current levels bear a strong resemblance to those of 2000 and 2008. In other words, it used a wealth of historical data that served to support its conclusion that we were about to experience a correction."

        text: 'Imagine that you work in a small company and a new boss has just been appointed. How likely are you to have the same birthday as your new boss? The answer: 0.27%, or 1 in 365.25 days (including the leap year). The probability is therefore very low. Now, what is the probability that two people have the same birthday in your company made up of 23 people? The answer: nearly 50%!'

        text: 'Such a high percentage may seem surprising, but it stems from the high number of potential relationships between each individual. There are no fewer than 253 possible relationships between these 23 individuals (individual 1 with individual 2, individual 1 with individual 3, etc.)'

So, with a bit of research, you will no doubt be able to find data that confirms your opinion or even financial data that seems to predict the future.'

        text: "Besides making me smile, the 1995 analysis by David J. Leinweber, Ph.D. explains this point well. Mr. Leinweber had managed to find a very strong relationship between the variation of the S&P\_500 and the production of butter in Bangladesh. The relationship with the S&P\_500 became even better if we added the production of cheese in the United States."

  By Jean-Philippe Legault, guest contributor

  A few weeks ago, I came across an article where the author predicted a major decline in the stock markets. Reading this article gave me goosebumps. Make no mistake, my dread came not from his negative conclusion, but rather from the process used to arrive at it.

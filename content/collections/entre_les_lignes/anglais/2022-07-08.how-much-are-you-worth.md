        text: 'Leo is a young man of 21 years old. On his birthday, he bought a lamp in a bazaar. When he got home, he rushed to clean it and, to his surprise, a genie escaped from the lamp. The genie had no wish to grant him but made him an interesting proposal. The genie said to him: “I am ready to offer you two million dollars today, in exchange for all your future pay checks.” Even though the offer seemed tempting, Leo was confused. Should he accept? To solve this problem, two elements must be considered.'

        text: 'The first step is to estimate his annual salary. How much money will he earn each year? Here is a hypothetical scenario. Leo will finish his studies in two years, so his income will start at 23. In the first years, his salary is likely to increase rapidly, as he will gain experience. In his 30s and 40s, he will potentially have a few promotions, which will accelerate his revenue growth. In his 50s, his salary might stabilize and grow at a rate that keeps pace with inflation. At 61, he will retire. Here is the salary path of such a scenario.'

        text: 'Based on this example, we estimate that Leo could earn an annual salary of $215,000 in 40 years. Some might find this annual income high, but it’s important to understand that $215,000 40 years from now is not the same value as $215,000 today. This point leads us to discuss the second element to consider; the discount rate.'

To help understand, if you earn $50,000 today and inflation is 2%, you will need to earn $51,000 next year to have an equivalent annual salary. Using a rate of 5%, $215,000 in 40 years is worth much less today – only $30,540.'

  Next August, COTE 100 will offer the opportunity for our clients’ children to attend a training session on investment. I must admit that it is always complex to explain the valuation process of a company simply. Here’s how I like to explain it.

        text: 'For example, I’ve a distinct impression that we hardly hear about cannabis in the financial media anymore and that the industry has lost a lot of its popularity with investors. I remember vividly that about two years ago that was all investors heard about in the Canadian media. Around that time, an investor told me he wanted to invest $100,000 in the Canopy Growth stock "because his golfing buddies were making fortunes with the stock and he just couldn''t take it anymore!"'

  My colleague, Jean-Philippe Legault, wrote an interesting blog during the summer for subscribers to the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin. He wrote that the Google Trends tool (link) “allows you to graphically follow the evolution of the interest associated with a keyword. More specifically, the tool records the frequency of use of a keyword on Google over a given period. We believe this tool helps visualize the impact that the media can have on the financial markets."

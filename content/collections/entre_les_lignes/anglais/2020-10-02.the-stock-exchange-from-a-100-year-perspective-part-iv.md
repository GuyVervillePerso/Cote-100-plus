        text: 'This week, in my latest blog for the book "Triumph of the Optimists", I touch on a subject that should interest all investors: the returns obtained by the stock markets of various countries around the world during the 20th century? Which countries offered the best and the worst returns? How do these returns compare to the returns for bonds and to the inflation? Finally, if we look at the American market, the largest in the world, what has been the distribution of its annual returns over the century?'

        text: "Let's start with the US stock market. The compound annual return from 1900 to 2000 was 10.1% in gross terms or 6.7% in real terms (after inflation). Such yields are remarkable. Imagine this: Someone who invested $1,000 in the US market in early 1900 and kept their investment until the end of 2000 (assuming they passed it on to their descendants!) would have accumulated the nice sum of over $16.6 million. Its real enrichment, after inflation, would amount to some $698,000."

First, I see that each of the 16 countries studied had significantly outperformed inflation, with an average real return of 4.7%. The second point to emphasize is that some countries experienced significantly higher inflation rates than others. For example, according to yield data, the inflation rate was 7.0% in the 20thcentury. Whereas, Switzerland recorded a gross return of "only" 7.6% over the century, but its average inflation rate was significantly lower (2.6%), which enabled it to record a 5.0% real return.'

This means that, on average, you can expect a negative annual return once every three years. Also, the worst year recorded by the US stock market from 1900 to 2000 was 1931 with a return of -31%. The best year was 1933 with a return of 57%.'

        text: 'Another interesting point is that the authors calculated the returns of the US stock market for the period on a rolling 10-year basis. Based on this, there’ve only been five 10-year periods with negative returns during the century, or 5.5% of the time. This statistic clearly shows that the risk decreases significantly when you extend the duration for which shares are held.'

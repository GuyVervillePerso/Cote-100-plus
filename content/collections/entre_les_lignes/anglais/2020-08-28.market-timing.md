        text: 'Despite this sound reasoning, this strategy is, in my opinion, highly questionable. So I asked him the following question: "What’re you going to do if the market stalls for the next few months and no correction materializes? Worse yet, what’ll you do if the market goes up 10%?” Convinced that a correction was imminent, he didn’t seem to have considered this possibility. Having made such a drastic decision, I doubt that this investor would be able to change course by reinvesting the liquidity if ever the expected decline didn’t materialize. This decision could seriously reduce his returns should his intuition prove to be wrong.'

        text: 'I then asked him this question, "What will you do if the market corrects 10%? Does this small decline justify an investor liquidating most of his portfolio?” His response: "I estimate the market will correct by more than 10%.” I continued my questioning, "What’llyou do if the market corrects 20%? Do you feel that this decline would be interesting enough to return to the market? If you''re willing to wait for a 20% pullback, why not 25% or even 30%? How will you know when the right time to re-enter the market has arrived?” He couldn''t give me a clear answer.'

In my opinion, a person who succeeds in correctly anticipating the exit point and the entry point should primarily be seen as lucky rather than talented. Neither he, nor I, nor anyone else can accurately predict a market''s peak or trough.'

        text: 'It’s precisely in times like we’re experiencing today that the value of careful stock selection comes into play. Like this independent investor, I see the general market valuation as being high. However, when looking at specific stocks rather than the aggregate of stock market indices, it’s possible to identify some stocks that are adequately priced or even undervalued. I’m thinking of Berkshire Hathaway, among others, which is currently not unanimously favoured by the markets. We believe the stock still has the potential to appreciate more than 20% from our estimate of its intrinsic value.'

He could thus avoid technology stocks which are strongly represented in stock market indices because of their good stock market performance in recent months. He could also select companies that aren’t very cyclical and have a good balance sheet.'

As an indication, the level of cash in our portfolios under management is equivalent to nearly 10%, a level that we consider adequate in the current context. COTE 100 will celebrate its 33 years in a few months. This long experience has enabled us to go through several “special” situations, such as, the tech bubble of 1999 and the financial crisis of 2008-09. Despite these extreme situations, we’ve always been able to stay the course on our strategy which can be summed up in four words: Prudence, Foresight, Patience and above all Presence. We believe it’s thanks to this discipline of investing that we’re now able to manage nearly $1.7 billion in assets owned by hundreds of Canadian families.'

  By Jean-Philippe Legault, guest contributor
   

  I had a very interesting discussion this weekend with an independent investor. Heexplained that he was going to liquidate most of his investments in order to keep nearly 75% of the value of his portfolio in cash. I believe there was some logic behind his reasoning. He argued that the stock market valuation is at an all-time high, unemployment is high, household and government debt is at an all-time high, and a second wave of COVID-19 could again dampen the economy.

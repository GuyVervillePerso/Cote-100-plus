        text: 'It must be said that the COVID-19 pandemic has probably clouded the financial performance of many companies somewhat over the past two years. Indeed, it has had a major impact on the financial performance of most companies. In most cases, company results suffered in 2020 from the consequences of the pandemic; in fewer cases, companies have benefited from the containment measures.'

        text: "That's why I think it's best to compare the results a company reported in 2021 to those in 2019, the year before the pandemic. Such an exercise can, in my opinion, allow investors to identify certain anomalies, or at least situations that deserve to be explored further."

        text: "In December 2019, this company’s stock was worth almost $108, slightly more than its current value of around $102.50. In 2019 (fiscal year ending in September), the company's revenues amounted to just under $12.1 billion. In the last 12 months ended December 31, 2021, revenues were $12.2 billion, 0.7% more than in 2019. More significantly, its earnings per share were $4.71 in 2019; they are 18.7% higher now, at $5.59 per share. In addition, during the same period, the company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio fell from 0.95 at the end of 2019 to 0.77 currently."

        text: "The company has come a long way over the past two years. In 2021, its revenues amounted to nearly $1.92 billion compared to $1.65 billion in 2019, an increase of 16.3%. During the same period, its net profits increased from $3.26 to $3.83, an increase of 17.5%. The stock is therefore trading at approximately 16.1 times its current earnings compared to 19.8 at the end of 2019. If I consider the company's net cash, which currently stands at $914.8 million ($6.61 per share) compared to $958.4 million ($6.40 per share) at the end of 2019, the adjusted price-earnings ratio is 14.3 compared to 17.8 at the end of 2019."

        text: 'In its fiscal year which ended in November 2019, before the pandemic hit, the company posted revenue of nearly $551 million while its adjusted earnings per share was $3.22. Perhaps more importantly, due to a few large acquisitions, its balance sheet then showed a net debt of $489.9 million, which translated into a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.23.'

        text: "However, in 2021, the company's revenue was $551.9 million, essentially the same as 2019, but its adjusted earnings per share was $3.59, 11.5% more than the $3.22 in 2019. More important, however, is the fact that during the period the company's net debt was reduced to $299.5M, a 39% drop over two years, while the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio fell significantly to 1.78. In my opinion, the company now finds itself in a position to consider acquisitions once again, the source of its historic growth."

Its current price-earnings ratio has thus fallen from 17.2 at the end of 2019 to 15.3 currently, while the company’s financial health has improved considerably."

        text: 'Sometimes, we despair when we see a stock stagnate for a few years. The example of these three stocks demonstrates that an investor should focus on the financial performance of his companies rather than on the price of the stock. There are probably many more such examples in the markets for those willing to take the time to analyze company results.'
chapeau: "Opportunities are generally associated with market corrections or sharp falls in specific securities. However, sometimes opportunities present themselves more subtly, as a company's earnings per share gradually improve."

        text: 'The more I progress in the world of the stock market and investment, the more I realize that the stock market is an extraordinary vehicle for anyone who wants to enrich themselves and prepare for a comfortable retirement. And the beauty of the stock market is that you do not have to trade often; in fact, I believe that the more idle an investor is, the more his chances of success increase. First and foremost, an investor will have to let time work for him.'

        text: ". Thus, the far-sighted investor will decide to invest in such a way that he earns, or at least does not lose too much, under almost all circumstances. This is where the concept of the safety margin takes on its importance, which is loosely translated into the concept “If it's tails, I win; if heads, I don't lose too much.”"

        text: '”. To me, this means that an investor should keep a long-term horizon and not expect or attempt to achieve high returns over short periods of time. It takes time and patience to find real opportunities on the stock market. Once you buy them, it also takes time for the planned investment scenario to materialize and for the undervaluation you identified to correct itself on the stock market.'

        text: 'Presence. We added this fourth "P" to the other three after a few years in the investment world. Indeed, we quickly realized that many investors are tempted to finesse the stock market by entering and exiting at seemingly appropriate times, what is commonly called "market timing". The savvy investor knows that it is impossible to predict short-term stock market movements and is committed to staying present (or invested) in the stock market for the long term.'

        text: "I see what is happening in many segments of the stock market and I can't help but believe that many investors have overlooked these four qualities that are essential for long-term success in the stock market. It seems to me that prudence and patience are two qualities that have lost all meaning to many of them."
chapeau: 'Despite the media making headlines about "investors" having made a fortune in recent weeks with a few stocks, I still believe that the best way to make a fortune on the stock market requires only four ingredients: Preparedness, Prudence, Patience and Presence. Since the inception of COTE 100, these four Ps have been the motto behind our investment philosophy. But every now and then, when the stock markets get particularly excited, there will be a wave of speculation that will make many believe that it is possible to make a quick fortune on the stock market by engaging in quick and brilliant trades.'

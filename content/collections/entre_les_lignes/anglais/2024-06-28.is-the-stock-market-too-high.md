        text: 'I must admit I have always had difficulty understanding the excuse of high market levels. Firstly, it is quite natural for an index to reach new highs on a regular basis. Over time, simply experiencing economic growth leads to an increase in corporate profits and consequently an increase in their stock prices. If you examine the very long-term chart of a stock index, you will notice that in reality, it consists of a series of new highs, repeatedly.'

If they had held it for 3 months, their average return would have been 2.9%, while over three years their average return would have been 40.2%.'

        text: 'I believe it is important to be cautious with this type of analysis. An important factor to consider is the influence that very large capitalizations have on the index. The most recent data indicate that the eight “megacaps” (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, NVIDIA, and Tesla) account for 30% of the S&P 500. What’s more, the profits made by these eight companies represent 20% of the profits made by the S&P 500! Thus, these “megacaps” have a direct influence on the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500. Without these eight companies, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 would be about 18.4 times.'

  BY JEAN-PHILIPPE LEGAULT, GUEST CONTRIBUTOR

  I recently had a discussion with an investor who was fearful of investing in the stock market as market indices had just reached new highs. Indeed, the S&amp;P 500 index has just hit a new peak, reaching 5,523 points, while the S&amp;P/TSX is also close to its peak reached last May.

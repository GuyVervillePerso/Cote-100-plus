        text: 'In the current period of high inflation, I would add that they offer the best long-term inflation protection. According to Morningstar, stocks of large US corporations have provided a compound annual return of 10.2% from 1926 to 2019. Meanwhile, US government bonds have provided a return of 5.5%, while inflation has been 2.9%. Short-term bonds (T-bills), which are similar to cash, returned 3.3%.'

        text: 'That said, for current liquidity needs and to cover contingencies, an investor should keep adequate cash in the bank. I believe I read that it is generally recommended to keep six months worth of expenses as an emergency fund. Such a sum seems reasonable to me in the event that an investor loses his job or faces significant unforeseen expenses. In my mind, these liquid sums are not part of an investment portfolio.'

And knowing that corrections and bear markets are normal and unavoidable – they are the price to pay for the superior returns of equities over the long term.'

chapeau: "I received an email from a reader recently asking me if I was still convinced that a long-term stock market investor should remain\_fully invested at all times. Indeed, in a recent article published in La Presse (“Des réserves avant l’hiver” or “Reserves before winter”), four experts recommended between 7% and 25% of cash in a balanced portfolio."

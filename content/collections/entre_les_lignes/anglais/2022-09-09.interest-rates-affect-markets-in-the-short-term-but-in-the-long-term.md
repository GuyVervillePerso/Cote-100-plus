(Good luck!) That’s why so many observers focus their attention on whatever the Federal Reserve and its Chairman, Jerome Powell, say about interest rates.'

        text: 'Second, notice how difficult the decade 2000-2010 was for the investor, with a return of -4.7% (again excluding dividends). I call it the “lost decade”. But what explains the poor performance of the index for the period is not so much the absence of earnings growth (49.2%), but more a decline in the valuation of the stock markets. You’ll notice that the price-earnings ratio was 15.0 at the end of 2009 compared to 23.5 at the end of 1999. And that’s despite the fact that interest rates came down during the period (from 5.1% to 3.3%)!'

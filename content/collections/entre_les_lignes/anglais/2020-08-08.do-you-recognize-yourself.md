  By Jérôme Lafrance, guest contributor
   

  This week I’m proposing a slightly different approach. Rather than commenting on a trend or phenomenon, I’ll discuss the psychological biases that can affect an investor's decisions. I invite you to read Philippe Le Blanc's recent post “Just because everyone jumps off the bridge doesn't mean you have to do it”, in light of which I thought it interesting to elaborate on the subject. I’ll discuss six biases that affect many investors and that are easy to identify with.

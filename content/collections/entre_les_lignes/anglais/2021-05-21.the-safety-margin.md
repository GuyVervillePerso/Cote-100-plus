        text: 'First, when you are valuing a business, get into the habit of setting a wide valuation range. Establishing a seemingly precise valuation, say, a valuation of $48.76 for a security, is in my opinion a dangerous exercise that fosters a false sense of confidence and security.'

        text: 'In our process, we establish three values for a company according to three possible scenarios: a pessimistic, a realistic and an optimistic one. We then attempt to weight each of these assessments according to the probability that we see for each scenario. So, for example, we could arrive at a valuation of $40 in a pessimistic scenario (with a probability of 25%, for example), of $60 in a realistic scenario (50% probability) and of $80 in an optimistic scenario (25% probability). In this example, we would arrive at a weighted assessment of $60 ((25% * $40) + (50% * $60) + (25% * $80)). But more importantly, we would have a valuation range between $40 and $80.'

        text: "Once you've established that valuation range, allow yourself a good margin of safety by buying at a price significantly lower than your valuation. In the example above where the valuation range was between $40 and $80 and a weighted valuation of $60, what price would you be willing to pay for the security?"

        text: 'For me, I would like to pay a price that will come as close as possible to $40. Ideally, in our management, we will attempt to achieve a discount of at least 20% from our weighted valuation. In the hypothetical case presented, we would be interested in buying for $50 or less. At such a price, we would be looking at a potential return of 20% over our weighted valuation of the company. At $45, the stock would seem even more attractive to us as we would then be looking at a potential return of around 33% while our downside risk (based on our pessimistic scenario) would be just over 10%.'

        text: 'The second habit that will significantly reduce the risk of error is to bet exclusively on high-quality company securities (I will write about this in a future blog). By investing in a quality company whose business model is protected by high barriers to entry and which has a high probability of continuing to grow over the long term, the importance of your initial valuation will decrease appreciably over time. Indeed, a company that succeeds in growing its earnings per share at an attractive rate for several years will see its intrinsic value increase significantly during this period.'

        text: "Let's go back to our example of a hypothetical society. Suppose that you made an initial valuation error by valuing it at $60 when its true value was $40. If this company succeeds in increasing its earnings per share by an average of 10% per year in subsequent years, it can be assumed that its intrinsic valuation will increase in tandem with its earnings. After two years, this value will likely have increased to $48.50. After five years, it will be around $64.50."
chapeau: 'Valuing a business is as much an art as it is a science. No matter how complex are the mathematical models used, the valuation of a business depends in large part on how we project its future free cash flow. However, as Yogi Berra once said, "itâ€™s tough to make predictions, especially about the future".'

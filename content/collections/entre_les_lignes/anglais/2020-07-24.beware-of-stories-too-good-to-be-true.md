        text: "A SPAC is an entity which has no operating activities and whose objective is to carry out an acquisition or a merger with an operating company using the sums it has collected during an initial public offering. Typically, units are issued at $10 each and each unit consists of one common share and an option giving the right to acquire a fraction of a share at a price a little higher than the issue price for a period of. approximately five years after the completion of the acquisition or merger with an operating company. Normally, 20% of the shares will be reserved for the management of the SPAC which often comes from the world of private equity funds. Interestingly, executives don't have to shell out any money to get their shares, it only takes the transaction with an operating company to be realized for them to get their shares."

        text: 'Certain mechanisms exist to protect shareholders, in particular the possibility of voting to approve or reject the planned transaction. If the number of holders who approve the transaction doesn’t reach the threshold specified in the prospectus, the transaction doesn’t take place and the monies are returned to the shareholders. Holders can also decide not to participate in the transaction and be reimbursed for the price paid for their unit.'

        text: 'Nikola Corporation is a company that used a SPAC to go public at the beginning of June. While the company wants to offer heavy duty hydrogen trucks and develop a charging network for them, it also hopes to produce an electric pickup truck at the same time. Although the company has no income at this time, its market capitalization exceeded that of Ford during the month of June.'

        text: 'It’s often easier for a private company to go public through a SPAC than to go through the more demanding route of the initial public offering. We can therefore have doubts about the quality of companies that go public through a SPAC and we often see that these companies trade at a discount compared to their peers.'

        text: 'For our part, we find it almost indecent that executives of one entity appropriate 20% of the shares for free simply for completing an acquisition or merger with another entity. In addition, we prefer to know what we’re buying when we invest in the stock market. Seeing the interest investors have in SPACs at the moment, we can see that our opinion is not shared by all investors.'

  Since the stock market rebound last March, we’ve seen investor enthusiasm for several investments that we consider speculative. Whether it’s the interest of individual investors in stocks of bankrupt companies like Hertz or Chesapeake Energy or the dizzying rise of certain stocks in the technology sector which reminds us of the excesses of the late 1990s, the signs of speculation abound. Lately, we’ve also seen an increase in investor interest in “Special Purpose Acquisition Companies” or SPAC.

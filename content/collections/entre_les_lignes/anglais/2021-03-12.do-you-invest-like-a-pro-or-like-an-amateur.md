        text: 'I also believe that there is a world of difference between being an amateur, which I was in tennis, and being a true “pro”. I always believed that the decision to become a professional involved a whole new level of personal commitment to your sport. The true tennis pro dedicates every moment of his life to his career and his development. There are no half-measures – he is 100% dedicated to tennis.'

        text: 'I recently read a book that I liked, titled "Turning Pro," by Steven Pressfield. In it, which has nothing to do with tennis, the author explains how an artist, an athlete, an entrepreneur or anyone who wants to achieve his creative dream must subdue his demons and adopt the attitude of a true professional to achieve it.'

I must admit that even when I'm on vacation, I can't help but think about the stock market, the companies in which we have invested. A trip to the grocery store becomes an opportunity to discover new products and new companies on the stock market. When I go to a restaurant in the United States, I always wonder if the owner is listed on the stock exchange."

He will likely have to write several and wait years for success. But he doesn't necessarily write for success and money, but because it's his passion."

Many of the tips Mr. Pressfield has given will make you an even better version of who you are. And if you are an investor, you may ask yourself this question: are you part of the pros or the amateurs?'
chapeau: 'In tennis, I never made the jump to the professional world. After completing my four years of college in the United States, I never intended to join the pro circuit. First, because I don''t think my level of play was high enough. Second, and most importantly, because it was not the life I wanted to live. From the outside, you get the impression that professional tennis life is indeed "glamorous" and that the players are living the high life, but I personally believe it is far from easy.'

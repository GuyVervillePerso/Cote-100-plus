        text: 'But how do you know if a business is of high quality? The quality of a business is subjective and depends on the perspective of each investor. However, let me introduce you to the factors that make for a high-quality business for me. You are free to incorporate some of them into your evaluation criteria.'

        text: "However, to aspire to this, it is preferable that a company's business model is protected by sustainable competitive advantages that will act as a sort of barrier to entry for potential competitors. Such barriers can come from a recognized trademark, low operating costs resulting from economies of scale, protection created by regulation or by patents, by the network effect, high switching costs, etc."

        text: '2. A high return on capital. There are generally two ways for a business to achieve a high return on capital: earning a high after-tax profit margin or by "turning over" their capital or assets quickly. A company like Pfizer achieves a high return on capital with a high profit margin, while a company like Costco achieves the same feat with a high turnover of its assets. For our part, we prefer companies that require little capital and can grow quickly without having to invest large sums in fixed assets.'

chapeau: 'In my most recent blog, I talked about two habits that investors should develop to increase the safety margin of their investment decisions. The first was to establish a valuation range that goes from a pessimistic to an optimistic valuation. The second was to focus exclusively on high quality corporate securities.'

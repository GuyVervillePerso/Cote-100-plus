As a result, the shoemaker is richer by $20, and the baker''s wealth remains intact since in exchange for his capital he now enjoys a pair of shoes. At the glazier, nothing changes, and he continues to go about his business. In addition to contributing to GDP growth, this seemingly mundane transaction enriches society as a whole as shown in the following table.'

As a result, he will own a window valued at $20 and his total wealth will be $80. Since the glazier will have installed a window worth $20, he will be richer by $20 and the GDP will increase by $20."

        text: 'Obviously, you can understand that this strategy will be very ineffective from the point of view of society. In this situation, the GDP measurement ignores the impact caused by the destruction of the storefront window, the "What we do not see" to which Mr. Bastiat refers. In this scenario, since the baker must reduce his capital in order to acquire a shop window, he will not buy shoes from the shoemaker. So, the destruction of the window will have a positive impact on the glazier who sells an additional window (we can see it), and negative impact on the shoemaker who will not sell shoes to the baker (we cannot see it). We can clearly visualize these impacts using the next table.'

        text: 'In conclusion, despite an equivalent increase in GDP in both cases, the destruction is not doing any good to the society. We can also draw a parallel between this parable and the impacts of the Covid-19 crisis. What we see: A meteoric economic recovery fueled by government subsidies and the injection of capital into the markets. What We Do Not See: The loss of wealth caused by this crisis, especially among small and medium enterprises, hidden behind these same government subsidies. When governments stop helping these businesses, will they be able to remain competitive and support the growth of the economy?'

  On July 29, the “Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)” in the United States published its preliminary analysis of GDP growth for the second quarter of 2021. The analysis shows an annualized growth of 6.5% of GDP during the 2nd quarter, for a total real GDP of $19,358.17 billion, or 0.81% higher than the previous pre-pandemic peak in 2019. We can also see the extent of the variation on this chart from the FRED database.

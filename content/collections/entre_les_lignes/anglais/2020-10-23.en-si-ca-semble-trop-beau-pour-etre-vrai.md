        text: 'In a "Ponzi scheme", an unscrupulous financier offers investors high returns through a mechanism that is generally opaque and mysterious, and supposedly risk-free. Many incredulous investors cannot resist such easy money promises. In Mr. Ponzi''s case, he promised a 50% return every 45 days. Just that! How can you resist such an offer, knowing that, with such returns, an investment of $1,000 would be worth the tidy sum of $2.85 million after only five years? With such promises, it’s understandable that many investors didn’t dare ask too many questions about Mr. Ponzi’s process.'

        text: "A Ponzi scheme can go on for a long time ... as long as new investors put in enough money to keep paying previous investors. But it's only a matter of time before the pyramid crumbles under its own weight. In the case of the original Ponzi scheme, it lasted less than a year and resulted in substantial losses for many surprised investors."

We only have to remember the name of Bernard Madoff who was at the head of the biggest Ponzi scheme in history and who went to jail in 2009, after having defrauded investors for the incredible sum of more than US $17 billion."

        text: 'People tend to believe that such frauds only affect others. Personally, I remember having a promoter come to our office in the mid-2000s. He offered to invest in an investment vehicle promising an 8% return "risk free and tax free". I asked him to explain to me how such returns could be possible when government bonds were offering around 4%. What I remember from his response is that the firm had developed a unique method using tax havens and leverage to achieve such returns. Naturally, it was impossible to go into the details of the strategy for "competitive reasons".'

Then, in 2012, I learned from reading the newspapers that the investment fund that had been offered to me was a fraud and that its main promoter, Mr. Allen Stanford, had been convicted of a Ponzi fraud and that he was serving a 110-year prison sentence.'

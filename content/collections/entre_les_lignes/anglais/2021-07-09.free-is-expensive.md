        text: 'As a result, companies like Facebook will use all kinds of tactics to increase your engagement and thereby the amount of data they hold about you, although it is well known that the algorithms used to achieve this goal lead to adverse consequences such as increased polarization. My goal is not to debate the merits of social media but rather to analyze another business model related to the financial sector that is akin to free services: that of Robinhood.'

        text: 'The company is expected to go public in the coming weeks and it may be interesting to revisit its business model now that the company has published the financial information needed to complete its initial public offering (IPO). The company has had spectacular success in the field of discount brokerage by eliminating commissions for trading stocks, options or cryptocurrencies. It has 18 million active accounts, and some analysts claim Robinhood could be awarded a valuation of US$40 billion on the stock market.'

        text: " but the information that surprised us the most in the case of Robinhood is that 81% ($420 million) of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2021 came from payments for the routing of customer orders. These revenues represent the amounts that the brokers or market makers are willing to pay to execute the transactions of Robinhood's clients. Even more surprising is the fact that almost half of these payments are attributable to option trades, a market normally used by sophisticated investors because it carries a high level of risk. It is hard to believe that the firms that pay Robinhood to execute these transactions are not making more profit from the information that is generated by these orders at the expense of the independent investors than the payments they make to Robinhood."

        text: "What's more, 21% of Q1 2021 revenue came from cryptocurrency transactions, another activity that carries significant risks for investors especially as the main cryptocurrency traded by Robinhood clients is Dogecoin, initially created as a joke."

        text: "In short, Robinhood's business model is based primarily on practices that we believe are subject to high regulatory risks and which could even eventually be prohibited. Remember that payment for the routing of customer orders is prohibited in several countries such as the United Kingdom. Cryptocurrency transactions are also likely to face increased regulation from regulatory authorities. Indeed, I recently read that a significant portion of Bitcoin transactions were linked to illicit cybercrime activities if we exclude speculative activities."

        text: "The decision to eliminate trading commissions has certainly contributed to the recent wave of speculation in the stock markets, particularly in companies such as Hertz, GameStop and AMC Entertainment. However, believing that transactions are free for customers is utopian. Companies like Citadel Securities derive considerable value from information on client orders and they use this information to enrich themselves at the clients’ expense. In short, we agree with Warren Buffett who sees Robinhood's business model as more gambling than investing, and we will refrain from commenting on the morality of such a way of proceeding. I would be surprised if the company would recommend its clients hold exchange traded funds for the long term."

  The advent of the Internet in the 1990s led to a proliferation of free services available online. You only have to think of search engines or social networks. Companies that offer these “free” services earn income by selling advertising. The more customers and the more information one has about the client, the more one can target them and the more expensive advertising placement is for businesses. In short, when it's free, you are the product and the more information one has about you, the more you are worth.

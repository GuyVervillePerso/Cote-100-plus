        text: 'You may have guessed that the book is about the stock market and investing. But I used the angle of another domain that I know well enough having waded in it most of my life: tennis. I see many analogies between the two worlds. I also believe that tennis examples help to better understand many facets of investing.'

        text: 'For example, the great Roger Federer recently announced his retirement from professional tennis. This was sad news for me, but it was also an opportunity to remember the qualities that made Federer a legend: his passion for the sport, his humility, his integrity, his "fair play", his longevity, his ability to adapt to changing conditions, his desire to win, his ability to stay the course in tense situations, etc. These are all qualities required to succeed in the stock market. With such qualities, if Federer turns his attention to stock market investing over the next few decades, let me believe that he will do very well there.'

And of course, for investors who have trusted us for many years, either by entrusting us with part of their savings to be managed for them, or by subscribing to COTE 100+ (the COTE 100 financial bulletin) to help them manage their own investments.'

        text: 'We have developed our own investment philosophy over the 34 years of our business. A philosophy that has always been articulated around the COTE 100 System that my father, Guy, developed at the very beginning of COTE 100. Over the last many years, we have nevertheless taken a definite shift towards quality. We now attach paramount importance to the quality of our companies, even if it means paying a little more. The sustainability of a company''s business model, the barriers to entry that protect it from long-term competition, the "optionality" and the "essentiality" of a company''s activities, are elements that have taken on a preponderant importance in our selection of securities and which I present in my book.'

        text: "In my opinion, the success of a tennis player depends on the development of three facets:\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ 1- the physical and technical aspect; 2- the strategic aspect and 3- the psychological aspect. In my mind, these three facets form the sides of an equilateral triangle. To be successful, each side of the triangle must be strong; a weakness in just one undermines the strength of the triangle…and the success of the athlete."

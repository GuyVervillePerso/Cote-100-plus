        text: 'Between November 22, 2021, and January 24, 2022, the Nasdaq index, largely comprised of tech company stocks, lost 19.2% of its value (daily high and low). We therefore speak of a good correction (the technical definition of a correction is a drop of 10% or more from a recent high) and almost a bear market (a drop of 20% or more from a recent peak). For its part, the flagship S&P 500 index lost 12.4% of its value between January 4 and January 24, 2022. Finally, the Canadian S&P/TSX index lost only 7.6% of its value between January 17 and 24, 2022, largely supported by oil stocks.'

I would place securities of companies such as BCE, Metro or Berkshire Hathaway in this category. In general, these stocks tend to get much less attention from investors during bull markets, but they usually hold up very well in bear markets.'

Most of the time, this part of the market is a tiny part of the whole, but it can pick up momentum during certain periods of high speculation such as the one I believe we have experienced over the past 12-plus months. It encompasses various types of companies that attract speculators. In my opinion, these stocks are attractive because they present a “great story” and vast potential for growth. These companies often have little revenue and even less profit. Last year, this category included securities of companies making the leap to the stock market (IPO), SPACs '

        text: 'In my 30 years of stock market investing, I have experienced many stock market corrections and bear markets. They are more or less part of the normal life of a long-term investor: from 1918 to 2018, there were 54 stock market corrections (one on average every 1.7 years), 20 bear markets (falls of 20% or more; one every 4.6 years), 12 drops of 30% or more (one every 7.6 years) and three drops of 50% or more (one every 30 years). Based on these historical averages, I could have expected to experience over 17 corrections, over six bear markets, almost four 30% declines and a 50% drop over the past 30 years! Seems pretty close to reality.'

The dramatic drop in early 2020 due to the COVID pandemic also remains etched in my memory. I like to believe that someone who has weathered these crises without losing their bearings and without panicking is capable of investing in the stock market for the long term.'

Most of the time, it reduces the excesses generated by a minority of investors, a minority that can sometimes take on significant proportions. Most of the time these excesses are concentrated in certain segments of the market – in 2000 it was in tech stocks, in 2008 it was in the real estate market – on other occasions the excesses will encompass the whole stock market (this was probably the case during the 1920s, “the Roaring Twenties”).'

Nevertheless, in my mind, a correction will usually start in a segment of the market where speculation has been the highest and where there has been the greatest excess. In such cases, the valuations of the most popular stocks became detached from economic reality. Speculators buy these securities for the simple (and not very good) reason that the prices of these securities are rising rapidly."

After the sharp correction in speculative securities, speculators will subsequently sell the securities which have fallen the least, often the securities of “typical” and more “conservative” companies. It is also quite possible that the fall in more speculative stocks will scare many other investors who had not yet invested in speculative stocks.'

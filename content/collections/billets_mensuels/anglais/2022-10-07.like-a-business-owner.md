        text: 'You are the founder and have been sole owner of a private company for 25 years now. You have experienced ups and downs over this long period, especially when you were just starting out. You clearly remember those difficult early years. The stress and uncertainty associated with losses incurred in the first two years. The difficulty of establishing yourself in your sector of activity and making yourself known to potential customers.'

        text: "More recently, the pandemic has also introduced you to a difficult period of great uncertainty. You had to close the doors of your business for a few months and invest in an increased online offer to get through this painful period. But you not only weathered the crisis, you also emerged even stronger. Your company's profit hit an all-time high in 2021 and it looks ready to set a new high in 2022."

        text: 'The last few months have been of some concern to you. The war in Ukraine is worrying. Inflation has become a serious problem for your business and for some of your customers. So far, you have managed to pass on the cost increases without too many problems, but there is reason to wonder whether your clients will be able to tolerate further increases. In addition, the challenges related to logistics and supply have been glaring for several months. It is difficult to obtain all the stocks and supplies required for your activities. Worse, it is increasingly difficult to find staff, a situation which you believe could continue.'

        text: 'From a macroeconomic perspective, high inflation has forced major central banks to raise interest rates significantly with the ultimate goal of controlling it. You are well aware that such an increase in interest rates will probably result in an economic slowdown, perhaps a recession. For this too, you can rely on your experience.'

        text: 'First, you are preparing for a recession. Even if it is not certain that it will happen, you believe that it is better to be ready if it ever does. You are therefore taking measures to counter a slowdown in your income and some erosion of your margins in the months to come. You are more attentive to expenses, and you make the decision to postpone hiring new employees.'

An economic downturn might reduce your profits, but it won't make them disappear. Over the past 25 years, you have succeeded in diversifying your company's sources of revenue and solidifying its business model. The services or products you offer have become embedded in your customers' operations. Unless they are experiencing serious financial difficulties, demand for your products should remain robust."

On the other hand, you believe that some of your direct competitors could experience difficulties because you know that they are not as solid as your company. Who knows, maybe a recession could even benefit you and could lead to acquisition opportunities or the disappearance of certain competitors?"

        text: 'For you, this is really not a good idea. You have been through several such recessions in the past – the one of 2008-2009 is still fresh in your mind. You know that when you have been through such tough times, conditions become even better for your business once the recession has passed. Also, if you wanted to sell your business, you would do so when the market conditions were right, on your terms.'

        text: 'Economic recessions and stock market corrections are normal and recurrent. Like the business owner, the investor should keep their eyes fixed on the long-term horizon. Like the business owner, he must prepare for the possibility of experiencing short-term challenging times. But he must also realize that the companies he owns are in excellent shape to weather a recession and emerge even stronger. And like the business owner, the investor must have confidence in their businesses and their attractive long-term growth potential.'

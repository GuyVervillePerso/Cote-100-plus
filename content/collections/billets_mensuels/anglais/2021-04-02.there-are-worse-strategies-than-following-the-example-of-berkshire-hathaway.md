        text: 'Like us, you are probably a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder. At the risk of repeating what you already know, Berkshire Hathaway, whose market value today approaches $600 billion, has been arguably one of the biggest stock market successes of the past half century – since Warren Buffett bought his first shares in the textile manufacturing company in early 1962 at $7.50. Based on the current price of $391,500 per Class A share, this is an annual compound return of 20.5% for a period of just over 58 years, a simply exceptional performance. The time and energy that can be invested in studying the factors that made Berkshire Hathaway successful will undoubtedly be beneficial.'

Why have so few investors not implemented the great investment principles that have made Buffett’s success, who is known as the greatest investor of the modern era?"

        text: 'But what puzzles me even more is the fact that so few companies have embraced the principles that have made Berkshire Hathaway successful for over 50 years. While Berkshire''s recipe for success has been dissected and widely presented by the media, how is it that so few business leaders have made "Buffettology" their management gospel?'

        text: 'In my opinion, the answer is because the path marked out by Buffett, while very simple and direct, is at the same time very difficult to follow without giving up or deviating from its course. It requires a few basic qualities that are unfortunately rare among investors and business leaders: the ability to defer gratification (or maintain a long-term vision), frugality, patience, prudence, integrity, rationality, opportunism, etc.'

        text: " Warren Buffett gave a good example of this propensity to favour the long term, discussing the operations of GEICO, a Berkshire company that provides auto insurance directly to consumers:\r“In 1995, GEICO spent $33 million on marketing and had 652 telephone counselors. Last year the company spent $242 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,631. And we are just starting: The pace will step up materially in 2000. Indeed, we would happily commit $1 billion annually to marketing if we knew we could handle the business smoothly and if we expected the last dollar spent to produce new business at an attractive cost.”"

As of December 31, 2019, Berkshire Hathaway had only 26 employees at its head office in Omaha. As the company has over 360,000 employees, that's one head office person for nearly 13,850 active employees in its various businesses!"

        text: "Berkshire Hathaway was built to last. I don't believe Buffett ever took a risk that could have put the company in danger. All of Buffett's decisions are made with a very long-term horizon in mind. Over the past few years, the company has been sitting on a mountain of cash (it had US$138.3 billion in cash as at December 31, 2020) as this cash offers virtually nothing in interest and stock markets continue to advance. For many, the pressure to abdicate and deploy this cash in the stock markets or by making a major acquisition would have been simply too much. But Buffett, though he will soon be 91, thinks, above all, about the distant future of Berkshire Hathaway and all its shareholders who in many cases have a large chunk of their fortune invested in his stock."

It has the responsibility of being profitable because the profits allow it to offer development possibilities to its employees, to continue to invest in its future growth, to improve its offer to its customers and to build a war chest to enable it to weather the inevitable difficult times. Berkshire Hathaway does not cut corners when faced with decisions that could harm some of its stakeholders - it always targets “Win-Win-Win” situations.'

        text: " All of Berkshire Hathaway's decisions are well thought out. I don't think I've ever seen Warren Buffett make an emotional decision. The company evaluates all the investment opportunities that come its way and compares them based on their potential long-term return and, more importantly, their risk. In recent quarters, its biggest investments have been buybacks of its own shares (it bought back $24.7 billion of its shares in 2020). You can be sure that the decision to buy back its own stock has been compared to many other alternatives. Small digression: I believe that Buffett’s decision to buy back shares says a lot about his thoughts on the stock markets and general valuations of companies."

In addition, Berkshire does not hire consultants to help develop its strategy or to implement compensation plans for its executives.'

Managers can be paid handsomely if they meet their goals, but they can also suffer if performance is not up to par. Another important point is that everyone's performance is measured over a long period of time."

That said, while the return of the Bulletin portfolio slightly exceeded that of our private management portfolios in 2020, the opposite was true in the previous two years.'

There is no magic formula, however. Still, I believe that less than 20 stocks probably provide inadequate diversification while more than 30 require a lot of follow-up work and will cause some redundancy in diversification. I know that many investors have this tendency to continually increase the number of securities they hold in their portfolio, buying a new security every time they contribute to their portfolio. In the long run, such a practice results in a portfolio of 50, even 75 or 100 securities. But, as famed investor Peter Lynch once said, too much diversification is not desirable - he called it '

It’s a bit like the law of natural selection (which we will regularly try to give a big boost: the strongest securities stay and the weaker ones gradually disappear). At the same time, if the security you want isn't more appealing than the least appealing security in your portfolio, you just shouldn't buy it."

As for putting more than, say, 4% in a security, that means taking increased risk. The experience of the last 30 years tells me that it is very difficult to know in advance which of our 25 stocks in the portfolio will do better in the next year ... We could take this to the extreme: why not just hold one stock in your portfolio?"

        text: "Over time, the market percentages invested in each of the securities in the portfolio will stand out significantly from 4% — the securities that have appreciated the most will take up an increasing percentage while the less performing securities will get smaller and smaller. We tend to let our winning stocks “run freely” in the long run. On the other hand, I would say that you probably shouldn't let a stock represent more than 10% of your portfolio. As for the stocks whose weight has dropped significantly, it is a question of determining whether we have lost confidence in them (in which case, we should sell) or if, on the contrary, we believe that they are still as (or more) attractive than before. In which case, we will reinvest to bring our position up to almost 4%."

This is one reason why we will be considering a few non-North American securities more and more in the coming quarters.'

The statistic hadn't been a major concern for the majority of investors over the past few decades, but things have changed in recent months, as evidenced by the following chart showing the annual US inflation rate since 1982:"

It can therefore be assumed that most of the increase in income comes from price increases in the products it sells. As for Starbucks, we wrote this in our analysis of its most recent quarterly results: '

I therefore like to consult the Standard & Poor’s site occasionally to get an idea of the valuation of the S&P 500. Here is what it currently says based on expected earnings in 2023 and 2024:'

        text: "Such ratios compare to a historical average of nearly 16.0 times expected earnings. We are therefore significantly above this average. But, as we have said many times before, you should not look at the price-earnings ratio in absolute terms, but relative to interest rates. When rates are high, as was the case in the early 1980s, it is normal for the price-earnings ratio to be low. On the other hand, when they are low, higher ratios are justified. Here's a chart we've shown a few times in the past that actually relates the price-earnings ratio to interest rates on 10-year US government bonds:"

According to a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, without the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500, the performance of this index would be negative since the beginning of 2023."

It must be admitted that these are dominant companies whose financial performance is exceptional. On the other hand, we believe that part of this dominance is linked to certain cognitive biases of investors, notably those of conforming (to “following the herd”) and of extrapolating recent outperformance. It is also likely that the growing popularity of index investing is contributing to the performance of these six companies."

However, it seems to me that we could expect a lower relative stock market performance from the mega-companies such as Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet. With a capitalization of more than $2,800 billion ($2.8 trillion) for Apple, how could one extrapolate a compound annual return of around 15% of its stock over the next 10 years? Indeed, such a return would translate into a market capitalization of $11.4 trillion in 10 years (not considering likely future share buybacks).'

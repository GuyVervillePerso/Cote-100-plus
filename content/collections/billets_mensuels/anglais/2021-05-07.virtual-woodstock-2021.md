This year, after being absent last year, the presence of Charlie Munger alongside Warren Buffett added to the interest of the event. I also appreciated the presence and the interventions of the two main operators of Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Greg Abel, of Canadian origin, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and vice-chairman of all non-insurance activities of Berkshire Hathaway, and Mr. Ajit Jain, of Indian descent, vice-chairman of insurance operations at Berkshire. In a post-meeting interview, Mr. Buffett also mentioned that Mr. Abel would be his eventual replacement at the head of Berkshire.'

For example, an inflation rate of 3% per year would reduce our purchasing power by half in 24 years. A rate of 5% would reduce it by half in less than fifteen years. Sworn enemy of banks, inflation would force them to mitigate it by raising interest rates, which would have a negative impact on all financial assets, starting with bonds. But to fight inflation over the long term, Buffett has always said stocks are probably the best investment. The same cannot be said of bonds.'

Leading the way is Apple with a market capitalization of over $2.0 trillion ($2,000 billion). Interestingly, five of the six largest companies in the world are American, which goes to show that the country has done quite well in recent decades. Out of the 20 companies on the list, 13 are American and three are Chinese.'

At least two observations stand out: of these 20 largest companies in 1989, none is among the 20 largest corporations today! In 1989, six companies on the list were American and are still well known today, including General Electric, Exxon, IBM and Merck. Interestingly, 14 Japanese companies were on the 1989 list. One can remember that 1989 marked the beginning of the end of the Japanese bull market. The largest company of 1989 had a market capitalization of $104 billion, nearly 20 times less than Apple's today. The 20th company on the 1989 list was worth some $34 billion compared to nearly ten times more for the 20th company on today's list. We can conclude that the capitalist system has created a lot of value, but that it is very difficult to know which 20 companies will make up the list of the largest companies in 2051.

In 1903, at the start of the automobile age, it would probably have been clear that the automobile was going to be a fast growing industry for many years to come and that this was the place an investor needed to be. Yet more than 2,000 companies attempted to enter the US auto market at the turn of the 20th century. As you know, a hundred years later, in 2009, only three of them remained, two of which went bankrupt in 2009.'

        text: "I won't dwell too long on errors of omission, although we've no doubt made many of them over the years. I am thinking in particular of our decision not to invest in the Costco stock when it was right in front of our noses. Not only did we know this company well as consumers (between them, my colleagues, Marc and Sébastien, have ten children. Needless to say, they regularly visit the Costco warehouses!), but we also knew it very well as investors. Charlie Munger, whom we have followed closely for many years, has owned shares of the company since its inception and sits on its board of directors. What's more (sorry, Claudine), a colleague at the office strongly recommended that we consider the stock several years ago. However, we remained seated ... and the stock continued to enrich the shareholders of the company:"

I could tell you about our costly mistakes that Amazon, Microsoft and so many others represent. When you identify such errors, you are a bit like the proverbial “Monday-morning quarterback”.'

        text: 'Over the years we have bought many stocks that we would have preferred not to have bought. In a special issue commemorating the 25th anniversary of the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin, in 2013, the study of all the stocks recommended and purchased for the Bulletin’s portfolio revealed this: "Over the past 25 years: on average, of all the stocks recommended and purchased, about 30% gave us excellent returns including a few big winners, 20% were big losers which caused us to lose a lot of money, 25% were stocks which provided modest gains and 25% simply wasted our time.” Obviously, the decisions that we would like to minimize (it is utopian to believe that we could eliminate them) are those that cause us to lose a lot of money. In this category, there are stocks of companies such as Kingsway Financial, Apollo Group, Rocky Mountain Dealership, Big Lots, and Maxar (among others).'

        text: " It seems to me that this type of error has been particularly costly for our portfolios over the past many years. Think about it: you own the stock of a company that you consider high quality, and you choose to sell it, perhaps because you think you have made enough money, probably because you consider it too expensive. It's the stock of a company you know intimately and trust for the long term and you sell it because it seems a bit too expensive."

        text: "Let's take McDonald's as a (painful) example. We acquired it in 2009 in our private management portfolios at a price of nearly US$64.00. In late 2015, we made the brilliant decision to sell it for around $116.00. Many people like to remember the saying that “no one ever became poor by taking profits” (apparently attributable to Jesse Lauriston Livermore, an American stock speculator of the early 20th century; curiously, he was also the one who would have said that “money is made by sitting still and not by trading”). We would have been much better off ignoring the first saying and making the second our own, at least as far as our McDonald's stocks are concerned."

By writing it repeatedly, maybe I will one day be able to adopt such a behaviour! Seriously, I believe we have improved this aspect of our management a lot over the years – we now own many high-quality stocks that we acquired many years ago (Visa in 2011, Berkshire Hathaway in 2013, CGI in 2003, Alimentation Couche-Tard in 2003, among others).'

First, any valuation is an approximate exercise, not a precise one. Second, we price our stocks based on expected earnings over the next 12 months. Our valuation therefore covers 12 months. So, a stock may appear well valued, or even overpriced, over a short-term horizon, but remain very attractive over a five-year horizon. I recently wrote a '

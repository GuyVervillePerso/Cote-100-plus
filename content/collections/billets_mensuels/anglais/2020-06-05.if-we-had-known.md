        text: 'Much (too much?) has been said about the pandemic. Personally, I believe that all that we can conclude is that we can’t know what we have in store for the next few months. There is a wide range of possibilities for the evolution of the pandemic and, consequently, the economy in the months and quarters to come. We’d all like to believe that the worst of the pandemic is behind us and that the economy will strongly rebound this fall; for now, that’s what the stock markets seem to expect. On the other hand, one could just as well foresee a second wave of contagion which would lead to new confinement orders and to the partial stopping of the economy. These two opposite scenarios are each just as possible as the other.'

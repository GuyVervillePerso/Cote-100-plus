Unlike a presence in the large CHI Health Center Arena amphitheatre, I did not have to queue from 6:30 in the morning, nor to rush to find acceptable seats in the amphitheatre, besides having heard everything and seen everything (even Mr.\_Buffett's few slides, which I never managed to decipher when I was there). At the same time, after having attended the company's annual meetings a dozen times over the past years, this year I still felt like I was present in the CHI Health Center arena."

Buffett, Greg Abel (CEO and vice chairman of all the non-insurance businesses) and Ajit Jain (vice chairman of the insurance businesses) answered numerous questions of shareholders, alternating between questions from people on site and those which had been submitted before the meeting in writing. For each element, I allow myself a personal comment.'

It is true that the stocks of the largest American companies, the hunting territory imposed on Mr.\_Buffett, are indeed relatively expensive. On the other hand, many stocks of mid-sized and small companies are not too expensive, but they are effectively out of Berkshire's reach. At the same time, Mr.\_Buffett's comments urge caution."

Under “normal” market conditions, it becomes increasingly difficult for the company to invest substantial sums."

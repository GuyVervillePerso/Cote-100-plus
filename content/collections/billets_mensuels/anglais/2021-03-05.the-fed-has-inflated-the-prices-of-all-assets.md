        text: "Frankly, I am amazed at the performance of the stock markets over the past 12 months. In my opinion, stock market investors should thank governments and major central banks for their strong intervention to counter the effects of the pandemic. Without it, the planet would very likely have been plunged into a severe recession. And the equity markets probably wouldn't have rebounded so quickly from their correction last March."

        text: 'There are, however, perverse effects of the marked drop in interest rates instituted by our central banks: savers find themselves more or less forced to take more risk in order to obtain acceptable returns. At the moment, a 10-year Canadian government bond offers a yield of 1.36% (which, by the way, is a big improvement from 1.0% a few weeks ago!). The same US government bond is yielding 1.41% (up from 1.10% a few weeks ago). Think about it: with a return of 1.36%, it would take more than 51 years for an investor to double his capital! Such a return, even ignoring the fiscal impact, does not surpass the rate of inflation. In other words, such investments will inevitably impoverish investors.'

        text: 'By forcing savers to take more risk, central banks have created another problem: the prices of virtually all financial assets on the planet are significantly higher. To my knowledge, the prices of houses, works of art, agricultural or forest land, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, …, all are much more expensive today than they were a year ago, before the pandemic hit. Here are a few concrete examples.'

At least that's what I see in the stock market where securities making their debut on the stock market (initial public offerings) are very popular. The immense popularity of electronic transaction platforms is also a testament to this quest for increased risk in the hope of obtaining returns."

Over the past five years, the return of the S&P 500 has been 15.06%, including dividends. Over the past 10 years, it has been 13.76%. In my opinion, it is unrealistic to believe that stock returns will continue to exceed the historical average established over the past hundred years.'

In my opinion, a security should not represent more than 10% of the value of one’s portfolio. Also make sure we don't have too much dependence on a few sectors. I know, for example, that many Canadian investors own a lot of bank securities. Also, it goes without saying that an investor should avoid investing on margin and stay away from the securities of heavily indebted companies."

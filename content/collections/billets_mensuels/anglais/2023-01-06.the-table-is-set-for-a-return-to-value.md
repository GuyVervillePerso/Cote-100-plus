        text: 'In my opinion, capital will still be available in the coming months (at higher rates), but especially for financially strong companies. On the other hand, it will be particularly difficult for loss-making companies to raise capital to finance their future growth. Paradoxically, companies that do not need capital will have access to it while access could disappear for those that really need it.'

        text: 'As far as the stock markets are concerned, I believe that this major change in the business environment will result in another equally major change: the return of “value” investing as opposed to “growth” investing. In the first case, investors are looking for value for their money – they are more concerned with the companies’ profits, their financial strength and the price paid. In the second case, investors think, first of all, about the growth potential of a company in the long term.'

        text: "After years of underperformance, “value” stocks have outperformed “growth” stocks in 2022. Thus, the iShares Value index fund of the S&P 500 (“IVE”) recorded a decline of 5.4% in 2022, which compares very favourably with the 29.5% drop in the equivalent “growth” (“IVW”) index. It's quite a turnaround: over the previous four years, from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021, the “growth” index had left its “value” friend in the dust with a return of 129.4% compared to at 51.1%."

Profitable companies in good financial health will benefit from the difficulties that will be faced by unprofitable companies that have put all their efforts into growing their revenues at all costs in recent years.'

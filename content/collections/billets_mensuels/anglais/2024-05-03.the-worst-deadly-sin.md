        text: 'The first is what the Americans call FOMO or “Fear Of Missing Out”, which I would call the “fear of missing the boat”. I believe that too many investors are influenced by this fear of not participating in the rise of stocks or sectors of the future. At the moment, this is probably the case of the phenomenon of artificial intelligence which has driven several technology stocks upwards in recent quarters. A few years ago, it was the cannabis industry’s fear of missing out. In the late 1990s, there was fear of missing out on the Internet revolution. It is often the case that investors feel a bit obliged to invest in the stock market, for fear of missing out on the high returns it has produced in recent months or years.'

        text: 'I remember as if it were yesterday an investor who called me several years ago (I think it must have been in the fall of 2018) and who wanted to buy Canopy Growth shares. From memory, he told me something like this: “All my golf buddies have made a fortune in cannabis stocks, and they can’t stop boasting about it! I cannot stand it anymore! I want to buy Canopy Growth shares and take advantage of this windfall!” The stock had experienced quite the rise in the stock market in previous years and was worth almost $600 per share (considering a 1-for-10 reverse split carried out in December 2023). Today it is worth almost $12. We managed to convince him not to invest in the stock, but if he had only listened to his emotions, he would have done so.'

How can we not be a little envious of those who invested US$5,000 in this cryptocurrency, for example, in December 2016 when it was worth less than $1,000? Such an investment would be worth US$320,000 today.'

We can blame ourselves for not having purchased some of these securities, but we should not blame ourselves for not having purchased all the stocks that are experiencing excellent performance on the stock market!"

The worst thing to do is to let yourself be influenced by envy and abandon your investment philosophy to participate in a “party” that does not suit you. Buying bitcoins or NVDIA shares today without having analyzed them objectively would be a mistake."

Also remember that for every stock that appreciates strongly, there is a plethora that appreciates gradually, year after year, without fanfare or trumpet. I bet you have several stocks in your portfolio that have performed well over the past few years. Other investors might be envious of such investments!'

        text: 'In recent months, we have made an adjustment to the way we manage our portfolios under management. In the past, we had adopted the strategy of allowing the level of cash to rise gradually when we found fewer buying opportunities, which probably meant that the stock markets were getting "expensive."'

        text: 'For example, at the start of 2020, we had the equivalent of two cash positions in our portfolios, which equated to just over 8%. This served us well as the markets fell over the following months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to deploy almost all our cash in a matter of weeks.'

        text: 'Another factor is that cash is not a good long-term investment. At the moment, the cash does not provide any interest (or a minimal interest rate) for investors. Whoever keeps 5% to 10% of his portfolio, continuously or for several years, in cash inexorably reduces his returns. Investing in cash will not surpass the inflation rate in the long run. By comparison, despite their short-term volatility, stock markets offer very attractive returns to long-term investors.'

When the markets seem expensive, opportunities are scarce, but they still exist. Since the beginning of 2021, we have acquired two new securities in our portfolios, even as the stock markets were reaching record levels.'

When they do arise, he would not want to be unable to take advantage of them – it will require sources of liquidity that are readily available.'

        text: 'In addition, we aim for portfolios that are made up roughly equally of “defensive” securities and “growth” securities. These “defensive” stocks (such as Metro or Berkshire Hathaway) typically resist any market corrections better. If an opportunity arose, we would then be able to sell some or all of these securities to buy another security that we found more attractive. In fact, over the past year, we have increased a few of our investments in a few of our more defensive stocks to be able to redirect their overweight positions to potential opportunities.'

However, there are a few positions in two securities that we consider very defensive that are unusually high: Alimentation Couche-Tard and Berkshire Hathaway. The portfolios also have some high positions in a few stocks that have done particularly well in recent years.'

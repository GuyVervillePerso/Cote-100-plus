Dalio is an investor whose decisions are based on global macroeconomic analysis. We are far from the philosophy of COTE 100, but its perspective is certainly worth considering.'

In "The Changing World Order", he recounts the failure of several past economic empires including those of the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom. According to him, each of these former economic powers went through similar cycles that eventually led to their economic decline.'

Reading this book, one can''t help but wonder, "What if we were nearing the end of the American empire and a devaluation of the American dollar?" One thing seems certain to me, this book and its underlying message will not make Dalio very popular among our neighbours to the South, but it is the kind of realistic message that is important to convey.'

Such a scenario would result from excessive indebtedness of the country issuing this debt and the possible refusal of foreign creditors to continue financing it. This scenario does not seem unrealistic for the United States over the next decades.'

The country is deeply indebted, and the only real way out is to print money, which the United States has been doing blithely for several years, and which sooner or later produces inflation and devaluation of the currency. In addition, it lists several key factors which characterize countries in decline, and which seem to me to be present in the United States:'

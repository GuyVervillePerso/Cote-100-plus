        text: 'March 2020 marked the end of the longest bull market in the past 100 years. Indeed, since the beginning of 2009, we’ve had more than eleven years without having observed the technical definition of a bear market, that is, a drop of more than 20% since the peak of the benchmark S&P 500 in the United States. During this period the market grew by 500% including dividends. March 2020 will also appear in history books as the fastest bear market as the index declined more than 20% from its peak on February 14 in just 16 business days.'

        text: "The dramatic events of the past few weeks, notably the progression of the coronavirus and the measures put in place to slow its progression, largely explain the sharp drop observed on the stock markets. Saudi Arabia's announcement to significantly increase oil production while demand is plummeting has only made matters worse."

        text: 'There are other factors more specific to the stock markets, however, that explain the scale and speed of the declines in recent weeks. The increase in volatility-based investment strategies that involve using leverage to invest in different asset classes with low correlation has increased significantly in recent years. The problem arises when stock market volatility increases or the historical correlation between different asset classes changes. These investors must therefore reduce their financial leverage by liquidating assets, which has the consequence of increasing volatility and the correlation between the different asset classes. The ensuing snowball effect partly explains the large stock market variations observed in recent weeks.'

        text: 'Other factors, such as margin calls and the panic of some investors, further accelerate the rate of decline. Thus, the stock market reached a trough on March 23, down 35,4% from its peak recorded on February 14 in just 20 trading days. During this short period, the S&P 500 index recorded two of the three largest daily declines observed since the 1930s (the other day being the 1987 crash). The largest increase was also recorded recently on March 24 with an increase of 9.4%.'

        text: 'A high level of volatility doesn’t necessarily mean a high level of risk for the long-term investor. On the contrary, it’s rather synonymous with investment opportunities. It’s normal for investors to be afraid when markets go down; it’s human nature. This same fear has allowed our ancestors to survive for millennia, but it’s a very bad ally for investing in the stock market. In reality, investors see low risk when prices are high, but it’s rather the contrary. The stock market has been less risky for the long term since the markets declined by more than 25% since their peak in February.'

        text: 'As long-term investors, we’re not trying to make predictions about the duration of the current crisis or the speed of economic recovery. We believe that announcements from central banks and governments will help weather the current crisis, although we’ll likely have to endure several difficult months before we see tangible results from a recovery. In sum, it seems unrealistic to think that the world economy will be able to recover quickly from the crisis as long as a vaccine is not available or that an effective remedy significantly reduces the morality rate, even if the measures put forward to control the virus are lifted. If we did our homework before the crisis by buying quality, low-debt companies whose business models are attractive in the long term, we should minimize the main risk of the current crisis, that is, avoid permanent capital losses (companies that go bankrupt before getting through the crisis). Thus, we should continue to generate attractive long-term returns. In addition, several companies could even take advantage of the crisis to acquire companies in financial difficulty or gain market share at the expense of companies which are constrained in their investment possibilities.'

        text: 'Avoiding short-term predictions doesn’t mean that we have no worries. What especially worried us for some time was the unsustainable trajectory of the debt of several states and more particularly the deficit of the American government which was on the way to approach 5% of the GDP of the country while the unemployment rate was at its lowest level of the past fifty years. In the short term, it’s normal for governments to spend to support the economy, but with hindsight, it’s also clear to us that the tax cuts and increased spending in recent years have only worsened the adjustments that’ll be necessary in the future to bring debt to a sustainable level in the long term.'

        text: 'Geographically, Canada and the United States remain in an enviable position despite everything when compared to other industrialized countries. The current debt level remains reasonable, the capacity to increase income is quite high, especially in the case of the United States. Demographic trends are also more favourable in North America. Greater openness to immigration means that the population of Canada and the United States is still growing and the aging observed in Europe and Japan is slower in North America. The best way to reduce debt is to generate economic growth. According to a recent Bank of Canada study, the potential for economic growth is 1.9% in the United States, 1.4% in the European zone and 0.8% in Japan.'

        text: 'In sum, a vertiginous increase in debt in the main industrialized countries is to be expected in the coming years and risks having negative impacts on future economic growth. The main industrialized countries have lived above their means in recent years. The bad news is that interest rates will not be able to rescue governments this time because they’re already at 0% or less in almost all industrialized countries. Two scenarios are therefore possible in our opinion in the medium and long term. First, governments will be able to raise taxes and reduce spending to reduce deficits and the level of debt accumulated in relation to GDP, which is likely to be unpopular in the main western democracies, with the possible exception of the Scandinavian countries and Germany. The other option is to go ahead with Modern Monetary Theory, which is to maintain a high level of government spending, but to use central banks as a source of finance through their ability to print money and thereby buy the newly issued government debt. This second solution will certainly be more popular with voters, but it’s not a silver bullet because it’ll invariably lead to higher inflation in the long run. If the results were so extraordinary, Zimbabwe and Venezuela would probably be wealthy countries at the moment. In this context, the stock market offers good protection against a rise in long-term inflation, which is certainly not the case for fixed income securities or cash. The real estate market also protects investors from a resumption of inflation, as well as safe havens like gold. However, we prefer to acquire assets that generate income which is not the case with gold. On the contrary, we generally have to pay to be able to store our ingots in a safe place.'

        text: 'In conclusion, we’re trying to remain realistic about the long-term market outlook and the many challenges that investors will face, including debt and demographics. That said, we have the opportunity right now to acquire quality North American companies at valuation ratios rarely seen since the financial crisis more than 10 years ago and when alternatives, such as fixed income, don’t generate income that can beat inflation. And while it’s not easy for investors to ignore the short-term information deluge, current market volatility must be viewed as investment opportunities.'

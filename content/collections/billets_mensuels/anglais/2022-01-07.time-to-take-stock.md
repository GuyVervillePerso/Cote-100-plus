        text: 'The start of the year is a good time to take stock of many aspects of one’s life. To paraphrase Mark Twain, January is a good time to take stock of your investments, as is February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December. All kidding aside, here are a few of my observations about the stock markets and our private management portfolio at the start of 2022.'

        text: 'First, the S&P 500 had another strong year in 2021, posting a total return (including dividends) of 28.7%. This exceptional return follows another exceptional return in 2020, namely 18.4%. As a result, should we hope that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue in 2022? (!) Over the past five years, the annual compound return of the S&P 500 Total has been 18.5% and over 10 years, 16.6%.'

        text: 'It must be said, however, that the profits of stock market companies have risen sharply over the past year, after suffering a certain decline in 2020 due to the pandemic. Indeed, the profits (excluding extraordinary items) of the companies that make up the S&P 500 index could reach $201.93 per share in 2021 (fourth quarter results have not yet been released), which would represent an increase of 65 % compared to 2020. More significantly, the benefits of 2021 would be 28.5% higher than those of 2019, a pre-pandemic year.'

        text: 'As of 2022, analysts at Standard & Poors are forecasting adjusted earnings growth of just over 9% to $220.46 per share, which translates to a price-earnings ratio of 21.6. Such a ratio is significantly higher than the historical average ratio of nearly 15.0 observed in the markets for a hundred years. Perhaps more relevantly, the average forecast price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 has been around 17.1 over the past 10 years.'

Right now, the 10-year rate on a US government bond is around 1.60%, near its lowest level in ages:'

        text: "I would also add that one must take into account that a few stocks of giant companies dominate the S&P 500 Index and play a predominant role in both its returns and its valuation. At the end of 2021, seven stocks represented some 27% of the index's value: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) and Nvidia. These seven securities are trading on average at more than 51.0 times their expected profits in 2022. If we exclude Tesla which is trading at nearly 125.0 times the expected profits, the group is still trading at more than 39.0 times the expected profits. We estimate that the rest of the S&P 500 stocks (498 companies make up the rest of the index) are trading at around 19.0 times expected earnings, a fairly high level, but which we feel is reasonable in the current low interest rate environment."

Overall, these securities are trading at just over 21.2 times the earnings we expect in 2022, which is in line with the American index. Note, however, that the portfolio is made up of American, Canadian and, to a lesser extent, international securities. The expected price-earnings ratio of the US S&P 500 and Canadian S&P/TSX indices is approaching 19.0.'

This means that our companies are in better financial health than average.'

Such a gap is explained in our opinion by the fact that we do not invest in money-losing businesses and favour those that are well established and with a robust business model protected by high barriers to entry'

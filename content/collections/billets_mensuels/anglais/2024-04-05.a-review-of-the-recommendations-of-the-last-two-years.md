        text: 'We published 23 Spotlights over the last two years (2023 and 2022), including 21 recommendations to purchase specific stocks and two special issues, a review of our best buying recommendations in January 2022 and a follow-up on the stocks of the COTE 100+ portfolio in December 2023. We have therefore achieved our goal of publishing 12 Spotlights per year for our “Platinum” subscribers.'

In fact, from the end of September 2023 to the end of March 2024, the value of the COTE 100+ portfolio appreciated each month, for a total increase of around 19.2%. In such a context, what should we do if we have cash on the sidelines?'

If you do not have such a horizon, you should invest in “safer” and less volatile investments such as bonds, certificates of deposit or money market funds.'

        text: 'North American stock markets have provided a compound annual return of almost 10% over the past 100 years or so. Of course, during this period there were dry spells during which yields were anemic. But history shows us that the time during which we remain invested in the stock market is much more important than the timing, the moment we choose to invest there.'

Once again, if you have a long-term investment horizon, I think it will be difficult to obtain returns higher than those of the stock markets. More often than not, the decision to sit on the sidelines can cost us much more than investing at an inopportune time. Talk to the investor who has done that in the last five months.'

        text: 'In recent days, a new variant of the COVID-19 virus has emerged in southern Africa and has already been identified in several countries around the world, including Canada and the United States. This new variant, called Omicron, would display around fifty mutations compared to the original COVID-19 virus. It appears to be even more contagious than the newer Delta variant. It is also possible that the vaccines administered to date are less effective against this new variant. On the other hand, it also appears that the variant does not cause more severe cases than the Delta variant.'

        text: 'I am far from being a scientist, let alone an epidemiologist. However, it seems to me that it is normal for a virus to mutate. Until populations around the world are predominantly vaccinated, the virus is likely to continue to mutate, probably (but not necessarily) in areas with lower vaccination rates.'

        text: 'This implies that we will have to live with health and containment measures that will resurface on a recurring and sporadic basis. We have already learned to live with these measures, but in my opinion, we should expect them to remain largely in place (social distancing, wearing a mask, washing hands, etc.). We must also expect that our movements will be restricted sporadically to slow new waves of contagion.'

        text: 'At the same time, I believe governments have learned a lot in the past two or so years of the pandemic. The future containment measures should be better targeted and less severe than in 2020. They were able to see the major impacts that the draconian measures had on their economies, and I do not believe that we will have to live through another spring of 2020 across the world.'

        text: "Also, more than ever, the whole world, and in particular the scientific community, is on alert and closely following the evolution of the coronavirus. South Africa's response has been swift and exemplary, warning the planet (at its expense?) of the Omicron variant which had recently started to spread in the country. Many governments responded immediately by temporarily closing their borders to people from southern Africa. For their part, pharmaceuticals such as Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were quick to announce that, if necessary, they would work on a more effective version to protect against the Omicron variant. We can expect a possible new dose of vaccine to better protect us against this variant and possibly other variants in the coming months. The world is much better prepared to deal with new viruses today than it was in 2019."

        text: 'The investor must also face reality. A rapid return to the pre-pandemic situation, such as what seemed to be hoped for by many investors in recent months, seems highly unlikely. Even if the economic outlook remains favourable for the next few years, it will undoubtedly not be without upheavals and difficult times.'

        text: 'Another factor to consider is the high inflation of the past few months which has been caused by both global supply issues as well as widespread labour shortages, issues arguably exacerbated by the pandemic. Further containment measures in parts of the world could exacerbate these problems and help keep inflation high. In my opinion, such a situation would significantly reduce the room to maneuver of governments to revive their economies. High inflation is a risk for the market in the short term. Over the long term, however, we believe the stock market offers protection against inflation that cash and fixed income securities do not.'

        text: 'That said, there are a number of positive factors for the stock market. On the one hand, interest rates remain very low. For example, the 10-year US government bond rate is currently 1.43% versus 1.68% a few days before the announcement of the Omicron variant.'

        text: 'In addition, companies in general are doing well. According to Standard & Poors (S&P), the companies that make up the S&P 500 index are expected to post adjusted profits per share of $202.09 in 2021, 65.2% more than in 2020 and 28.6% more than in pre-pandemic 2019. For 2022, S&P analysts are forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $219.77, which would represent an 8.8% growth rate from 2021. Of course, the question is how the arrival of the Omicron variant will affect this growth, but I believe that robust growth in corporate earnings can be expected in 2022. If the S&P earnings forecast materializes in 2022, the S&P 500 Index is trading at 20.8 times the expected profits, a historically high level, but which does not seem unreasonable to us in a context of particularly low interest rates.'

        text: 'On our side, our companies are also doing very well. Overall, in their most recent quarter, earnings per share of the companies in the COTE 100 Bulletin portfolio increased 17.8% (weighted average) from a year earlier and 22.1% from two years ago. Of the 24 companies in the portfolio, only four posted lower profits in their last quarter than two years earlier. I would add that our companies are in excellent financial health. According to our calculations, they have an average net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.57 in their most recent quarter compared to 0.67 at the end of 2019.'

        text: 'We are staying the course for the long term. We still believe that the equity markets offer attractive prospects for returns over the next few years, although they will likely be much lower than the past decade or so (which frankly has been exceptional). However, we recommend that you remain cautious and favour the securities of quality companies in good financial health. It seems to me that this is a particularly bad time to speculate in certain popular and risky segments of the market, let alone using debt.'

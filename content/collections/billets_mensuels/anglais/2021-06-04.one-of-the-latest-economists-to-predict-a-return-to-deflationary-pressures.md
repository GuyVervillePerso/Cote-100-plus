        text: 'I was fortunate enough to attend a webcast with David Rosenberg, President, Economist and Chief Strategist of Rosenberg Research. Mr. Rosenberg was Chief Economist for North America at Merrill Lynch from early 2002 to 2009 before joining Gluskin Sheff in 2009. He gained notoriety for predicting the collapse of the US real estate market in 2008-2009 and he is known to have a contrarian opinion. Some will even claim that he can be considered a "permabear", an investor who always foresees a decline in the stock markets.'

        text: 'It is difficult to question that his current economic outlook is against the grain because he continues to believe that the inflationary pressures of the last few months are transitory and that deflationary pressures will reappear at the end of 2021 and this despite extremely accommodating monetary and fiscal policies.'

        text: 'His arguments are based on the fact that the pandemic has created significant damage to the economy in terms of labour underutilization and that when the effect of the various government programs wears off, the resumption of the economy will be more modest than anticipated. Thus, the increase in US government spending represented 8% of GDP in 2020 and 28% of household income came from the government, while the average of the last ten years is around 17%. 15% of the workforce is still under an employment insurance program compared to 2% before the pandemic.'

        text: 'The various sectors that will greatly benefit from the economic recovery, such as restaurants, hotels, entertainment, and tourism, represent only 4% of US GDP. The largest component, durable goods, which accounts for 10% of GDP, is already at an all time high. With the level of durable goods stocks per capita already at its highest ever, there is unquestionably little room for growth.'

        text: 'Mr. Rosenberg believes that rising commodity prices will have little impact on the level of inflation for a country like the United States that is increasingly service-oriented. In addition, he believes that the current price hike is unsustainable and that prices will decline when the supply disruptions related to the pandemic subside. Unlike the United States, China is trying to reduce its level of debt, especially in the corporate sector, which will also reduce the upward pressure on commodity prices.'

        text: "vIt is currently not difficult to find economists who disagree with Mr. Rosenberg's prognosis. Larry Summers, former Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and professor at Harvard University is one. He believes the size of the US government's latest $1.9 trillion aid package was unwarranted and the $2 trillion saved by households during the pandemic, asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve's key rate at 0% as well as the high valuation of assets, especially stocks and real estate, will lead to a sharp increase in demand and put upward pressure on the inflation rate."

        text: 'We believe that it is difficult to predict economic cycles because it is a highly complex system. Besides, we are not trying to predict the direction of the economy in the short or medium term. We try to build portfolios that will be able to perform well regardless of the level of economic growth, both in inflationary and deflationary times. By owning companies with low debt, whose business model is protected by high barriers to entry and low cyclicality, we should be able to achieve an attractive long-term return while minimizing the downside risk of the portfolios.'

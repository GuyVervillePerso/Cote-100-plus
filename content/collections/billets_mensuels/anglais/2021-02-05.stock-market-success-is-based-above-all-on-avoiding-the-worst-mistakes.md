For example, it is much more rewarding to recommend the purchase of stocks than to warn investors of the pitfalls that lie in wait for them in the markets.\rHowever, I am convinced that the success of the long-term investor depends more on his ability to avoid the worst mistakes than on the good moves he can make with certain stocks.

There is a strong temptation to want to make fast high returns, especially when everyone seems to be participating happily.

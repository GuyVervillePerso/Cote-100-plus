        text: 'The first half of 2022 had the worst stock market performance since 1970. In the six months, the S&P 500 lost 20.6% of its value, the Nasdaq, 29.5%, and the S&P/TSX, 11.1% (all, excluding dividends). The best relative performance of the Canadian market is mainly due to the oil sector, which recorded a return of 23.5% and ended the six months with an 18.4% weighting of the index.'

        text: 'The first is negative. This is, in my opinion, the most common and is fueled by the messages that the media bombard us with. Here, investors will focus their attention on what they lost in this bear market. Some investors will wonder if the correction diverts them from their retirement plans. Many will question their decision to invest in stocks.'

        text: 'The second is rarer and counter intuitive. It consists in reversing our perception of the market decline by realizing that it will have positive effects in the years to come. I believe that the significant decline in the bear markets of the past few months, which mainly reflects the sharp rise in interest rates, will have largely eliminated many of the excesses observed in recent years in the stock markets and in the economy. More importantly, it improves the outlook for stock market returns over the next few years.'

        text: 'As of December 31, 2021, before the stock markets began their correction, we estimated that the return for the next 12 months of our portfolio was close to 9%. This potential return is calculated on the basis of the assessments we make of each of our securities in the portfolio and which are updated at least quarterly on the basis, among other things, of the most recent results of each of our companies, their outlook for the year to come and the evolution of interest rates.'

        text: 'Six months later and after a significant drop in the markets, we expect a return of 22.5% for the same portfolio over the next 12 months. It should be noted that our valuations have been updated after the most recent financial results and that they take into account the significant increase in interest rates during the period which has contributed to lowering the valuation of most of our companies.'

        text: "But in addition to increasing the upside potential, I believe the market decline has also significantly reduced the portfolio's downside risk. Doesn't that make sense: the lower the stocks, the higher the upside potential and the lower the downside risk?"

        text: 'As I have often said, the valuation of a company is not a precise exercise. We must consider several possible scenarios in our assessment and assign them a probability. So, for each stock we hold, we establish a valuation for a realistic (most probable) scenario, a pessimistic scenario, and an optimistic scenario.'

        text: 'I will draw your attention here to the pessimistic scenario that we establish. In this case, we try to predict what the value of a company could be, in the event of an unfavourable economic scenario, significantly lower than expected earnings and lower valuation ratios. In this calculation, we try to establish the worst-case scenario in order to measure the downside risk of a security.'

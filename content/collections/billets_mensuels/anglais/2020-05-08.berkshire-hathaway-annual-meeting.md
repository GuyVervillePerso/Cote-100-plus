        text: "Last Saturday, I watched the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Due to the pandemic, it was broadcast exclusively by video for the first time in the company’s history. Warren Buffett made a presentation of about two hours with the help of a few slides (a first!). Then he and Greg Abel, the company's vice president in charge of all of the company's non-insurance activities, answered many questions from the public that were selected by three journalists who’ve followed the company for many years. The assembly lasted approximately four and a half hours and the two colleagues were installed on a podium in the Omaha Civic Auditorium, where the assembly should have taken place in front of more than 18,000 people from all over the United States and many countries of the world. Charlie Munger, long-time partner of Warren Buffett and now 96, was unfortunately unable to attend, as the risk of traveling from California to Omaha was too great in the context of the pandemic."

        text: 'First, I’d say that Warren Buffett is just as optimistic as before the crisis about the enrichment and development potential of the United States over the next many years. According to him, "never bet against America". That said, while he remains very optimistic in the long term, he believes the short- and medium-term prospects are very uncertain due to the pandemic and its future impact on the economy.'

        text: 'For him, "The range of possibilities on the economic side is still very wide", which calls for caution. He compares the current crisis to that of 2008-2009 as follows: “In 2008 and ''09, our economic train went off the tracks. This time, we just pulled the train off the tracks and put it on a siding."'

        text: "Second, we saw how conservative Warren Buffett is. As of March 31, the company had approximately $137.3 billion in cash, which represents almost 30% of the company's market capitalization. Despite falling markets during the quarter, Buffett was not very active in buying stocks. Net purchases for the quarter amounted to only $1.9 billion, an insignificant amount when you consider its cash and investment portfolio is worth more than $180 billion. I was also surprised to find that the company was not very active in buying back its own shares, having bought for only $1.74 billion, even if its stock had fallen more than 30% in the first quarter."

        text: 'As of mid-March, Buffett and Charlie Munger had started to receive a few calls from companies seeking funding. These first calls didn’t lead to transactions because, according to Buffett, the size of these financings was not large enough and the companies that wanted them were not of the quality sought by Messrs. Buffett and Munger. They were expecting other similar calls, but then the Federal Reserve began to vigorously inject liquidity into the credit market. From that moment, the Berkshire Hathaway phone stopped ringing. Buffett said this could change in the future.'

This is precisely what was done in recent weeks by selling all of the shares that Berkshire Hathaway owned in the four largest American airlines (Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines).'

        text: 'Fourth, Warren Buffett is always rational. He believes that it’s impossible to predict how the current pandemic will develop, both in terms of health and its future impact on the economy. Although it has tightened somewhat over the past few weeks, he believes that the range of possible scenarios is still vast, which significantly complicates the valuation of companies.'

        text: 'First, the current crisis is probably not over. In the worst-case scenario, it could stretch for many months, which would have a major negative impact on the US and global economies. Buffett manages Berkshire Hathaway for the long term and above all he wants to protect himself from the worst possible scenarios. Having $137.3 billion in cash may seem ultra-conservative, but it makes perfect sense when you remember that the company is primarily an insurance company and that it could at any time be called upon to pay a substantial amount in claims. This is even more important when you remember that many investors have been shareholders in the company for many, many years and that the Berkshire stock is in many cases a substantial proportion of their pension funds.'

The environment for the next few years will change dramatically for many companies in the tourism and group entertainment industries."

        text: 'The long-term investor should favour the southeast quadrant, where businesses require little capital and where demand is relatively stable, hardly affected by economic cycles. As Warren Buffett said at the annual meeting, this is where we find the most beautiful companies and incidentally, it’s in this quadrant that the American companies of greatest value are found, the FAANG: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (now called Alphabet). We could add Microsoft to this select group. Collectively, these six companies are worth almost $5.5 trillion (1 trillion being 1,000 billion), or close to 23% of the total $24.1 trillion capitalization of the 500 companies in the S&P 500. For Buffett, it isn’t necessarily a surprise that these companies are worth so much since they can grow in gigantic markets without having to invest significant sums of capital and while the demand for their products and services remains relatively stable, whatever the economic conditions.'

        text: 'If it were possible to do so, it’s in this quadrant that an investor would like to concentrate stock market investments. However, I note that we hold several securities in our managed portfolios that I’d place precisely in this quadrant. I invite you to try placing your portfolio companies in the appropriate quadrants.'

        text: 'In contrast, the northwest quadrant, the one characterized by high capital intensity and low demand stability, is the one that an investor should try to avoid as much as possible. It’s precisely in this quadrant where we find the companies that have been hardest hit by the pandemic: airlines, hotel chains, oil producers, cruise companies. Buffett admitted he made a mistake by investing $7-8 billion in the four largest American airlines; they’re all part of this quadrant.'

        text: 'In my opinion, the southwest quadrant, which is characterized by relatively low capital intensity and rather unstable demand, includes banks and retailers, for example. Overall, these companies will be affected by the coronavirus crisis, but most of their business models will allow them to adjust. There are good investments to be made in this quadrant, but I’d emphasize the importance of choosing companies whose business model is protected by high barriers to entry.'

        text: 'The northeast quadrant (high capital needs and stable demand) also has attractive investments, but again less attractive than those in the southeast quadrant. This is where we find public utilities and rail carriers (BNSF) for example. In this segment, high capital requirements often provide high barriers to entry for well-established businesses. It’s in this quadrant where the BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy divisions would be found.'

        text: "The fact remains that the investor should in my opinion try to eliminate the companies that are in the northwest quadrant from its portfolio and favour as much as possible those in the southeast quadrant. This is precisely what Buffett did by selling Berkshire's investments in airlines."

        text: 'The third conclusion I draw from the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting is that investors will need to be patient in the months to come. While a rapid economic recovery is possible, it’s unlikely. I believe Mr. Buffett is preparing for a long period of economic hardship that could eventually lead to attractive investment opportunities for Berkshire Hathaway.'

        text: 'The most likely scenario is a very gradual economic recovery until a vaccine is developed, produced and distributed worldwide, which could well take a year or more. In the meantime, I believe we’ll have to be patient and keep the best quality companies in our portfolio, be more intransigent towards the least well-positioned companies (northwest quadrant) and be very selective in our new investments, in particular in terms of the valuation that we will be willing topay for the securities of these companies.'

        type: text
        text: 'In the long term, I totally agree with Warren Buffett, the growth outlook for the United States remains very favourable (as well as for Canada) and stocks are probably the best investment to make. But even if we continue to favour securities for the long term, prudence and selection are even more important in the current context.'

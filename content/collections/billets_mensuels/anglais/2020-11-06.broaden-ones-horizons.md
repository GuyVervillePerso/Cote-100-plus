        text: 'I’ve always considered it best to invest in North America in order to reduce risk. I still believe it. In my opinion, many international markets offer attractive growth potential, but the risks are generally greater there. This is why we’ve always preferred to invest in North American companies that had a significant international presence rather than investing directly in international companies.'

        text: 'The problem is, I’m finding it increasingly difficult to locate opportunities in North America, especially the United States. At the time of this writing, the S&P 500 Index is trading at around 20.0 times the expected earnings of 2021, significantly higher than the historical average ratio of nearly 15.0. As for the Canadian market, it seems to us that it offers a very limited number of quality companies, even less if we also take into account their valuation. I would add that the Canadian stock market represents less than 3% of the world market, which shows how small its market is. By way of comparison, the US market represents over 54% of global market capitalization, Japan just under 8% and the UK almost 5% (source: statista.com).'

        text: ', by Christopher Risso-Gill, features the investment approach of Peter Cundill, a renowned Canadian “value” investor who has long been in charge of the Cundill Value Fund. Mr. Cundill believed that a Canadian investor looking for bargains should favour the North American market, without ignoring international market opportunities. Throughout his long and successful career as a portfolio manager, Mr. Cundill has invested in companies in many countries outside of North America with great success. He had developed the habit of visiting the country with the worst-performing stock market in the previous year to find investment opportunities.'

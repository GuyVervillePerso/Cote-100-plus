        text: 'Of all insider trading, I value purchases the most. Indeed, many reasons can motivate the sale of shares by an insider, whether it is the payment of taxes, the diversification of one’s portfolio, the purchase of a boat, the exercise of options, etc. But, to my knowledge, there is only one good reason to buy stocks: the hope of making a good profit!This is why we pay close and regular attention to insider buying (we get daily automated reports).Technically, an insider is a person whose position, as an officer or director, or as a major shareholder (10% or more of the shares) in a publicly traded company, places it in a privileged position compared to other shareholders.In theory, and in fact, an insider is in a better position than ordinary mortals to know when the stock of the company it leads is a good buying opportunity. Purchases made by U.S. executives between 2015 and 2020 outperformed the S&P 500 over the ensuing 12 months by an average of five percentage points, according to a TipRanks analysis.In short, an investor must remain on the lookout for insider buying.I have noticed a few insider purchases that have been made since the beginning of 2022 and which I consider significant, both among the companies in the portfolio of the Financial Bulletin by COTE 100 and among certain companies whose stock we have recommended in the past.

        text: 'Obviously, the greater the sums invested by insiders in purchases, the more relevant the message is for investors. Along the same lines, multiple insiders of the same company buying the company’s shares is an even more powerful message.In my view, insider buying should be viewed as a strong signal that some insider believes the stock is a bargain. In my opinion, it would be a mistake to base investment decisions exclusively on such purchases – insiders can be wrong too. However, when such purchases confirm our own assessment of a security, the signal becomes particularly strong.'

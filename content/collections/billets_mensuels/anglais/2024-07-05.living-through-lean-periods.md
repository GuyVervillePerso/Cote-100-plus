        text: 'As of June 30, the COTE 100 Financial Letter portfolio shows a return of only 3.3%, a performance I find rather disappointing. Since the beginning of 2024, the Canadian S&P/TSX has posted a total return of 6.1%. Meanwhile, the American S&P 500 has risen by 15.3% (19.6% in Canadian dollars) over the same period. These are our two main benchmark indices.'

        text: "Firstly, it's important to understand the performance of the benchmark indices we compare ourselves against. I believe the performance of the S&P 500 is somewhat misleading. Indeed, it has been concentrated in a handful of the largest American companies, especially the top seven companies known as the \"seven magnificent\". Between January 1 and June 30, 2024, the S&P 500 (excluding dividends) has appreciated by 14.5%. However, excluding the seven magnificent, the S&P 500 would have risen by around 5%. The performance of these seven companies has contributed over 60% of the index's return since the beginning of the year. In other words, if you didn't hold some of these stocks in your portfolios, your performance since the beginning of the year would likely have been significantly lower."

For example, $100,000 invested initially in this portfolio would have been worth over $5.2 million as of June 30 last year (these returns do not include management fees). Over the same period, the S&P/TSX index recorded a compounded annual return of 8.2%, while the S&P 500 posted a compounded annual return of 11.2%.'

The temptation was particularly strong at the time - and many investors encouraged us - to invest in these tech stocks where it seemed so easy to achieve high and fast returns. As I reread these lines at the beginning of 2021, I cannot help but notice how markets can repeat the same follies. Indeed, some investors blame us for not having invested in star stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, or Facebook!'

When I examine each of our companies, I believe I am not mistaken in saying that this will be the case. The portfolio companies are of high quality, and their valuation seems reasonable to us.'

With the announced tax changes, we will aim to hold our securities even longer.'

        text: 'I admit that the news we have been bombarded with for months is rather dark and anxiety-inducing. On the geopolitical level, the war in Ukraine continues, a war between Israel and Hamas has just broken out and many observers fear that it will spread to the Middle East, the United States and China are constantly launching arrows at each other in their trade war, and so on. As for the economy, inflation and high interest rates are affecting a growing number of consumers, starting with the least well off who are struggling to make ends meet. There is still a shortage of labour and affordable housing. Politically, it seems that many countries have never been more polarized between left and right. In the United States, we can fear a divisive presidential campaign where all low blows will be permitted. The climate news is hardly more encouraging with natural disasters occurring all over the world.'

In fact, nostalgia, this tendency to believe that “it was so much better in the good old days” is, in my opinion, another psychological bias from which most of us suffer. But was it really better before?'

        text: '“Having read a book by a certain M. Le Blanc more than 30 years ago, I followed some of his advice and of course, “La Bourse ou La Vie”… I am therefore attaching two statements of account of my self-directed investments "done my way" and applying many of these tips... The last line [of my account statements] clearly indicates that I learned quite well from the advice I read in his first book and which I profit from in my U.S. investments that I entrusted to you.”'

        text: 'This investor started investing in the early 1980s. At first, he mostly relied on the advice of his broker, but over time, he began to make his own decisions based on his knowledge and reading. In fact, after only a short while, he realized that his broker was encouraging him to make too many trades and he politely asked him to stop calling him. The Les Affaires newspaper was an excellent source of information for him, in particular the writings of journalist Claude Beauchamp, who died in 2020. From the end of the 1980s, our investor subscribed to the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin.'

Although I do not know the returns he has obtained over the years, I suspect they are very satisfactory, considering the substantial unrealized gains of the portfolio and the long-term performance of the securities in the portfolio.'

You will also note that this investor has chosen to concentrate his investment activities in Canada, a country whose companies he knows well, and has preferred to entrust COTE 100 with the management of the American part of his investments.'

When he needs cash for his personal needs or for other reasons (he has in the past paid dividends to his children who are shareholders of his management company), he sells a few shares of a security which seems well valued or represents a large percentage of the portfolio; he did so a few years ago by selling 2,000 of his Couche-Tard shares.'

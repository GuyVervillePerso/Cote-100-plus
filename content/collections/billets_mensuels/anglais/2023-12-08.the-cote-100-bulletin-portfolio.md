        text: 'The COTE 100+ Bulletin portfolio has appreciated by 12.0% since the start of 2023 (as of November 30). I am satisfied with this performance, although I know very well that a return over such a short period does not mean much.'

        text: 'Rather, my goal is to highlight how stock markets are unpredictable and portfolio returns can occur over short periods of time, often when least expected. Note, however, that as of September 30, the return that the portfolio had obtained since the start of 2023 was only 3.2%. Thus, the return for the last two months was 8.5%.'

        text: 'How can we explain such a market rebound? I believe it is mainly attributable to the recent deceleration in the rate of inflation, which has resulted in a drop in interest rates over the last couple of months. Indeed, as the following graph illustrates, the interest rates on a 10-year US government bond went from nearly 5.0% in mid-October to nearly 4.23% now.'

        text: 'Since 1988, almost 36 years, the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio (a real portfolio which pays transaction commissions, but no management fees) has recorded a compound annual return of 11.45%. Thus, $100,000 invested at the beginning of 1988 would be worth more than $4.95 million today.'

        text: 'There are therefore two major variables that influence the performance of a stock market investor: return (r) and time (t). In my opinion, it is possible to improve your returns by reducing costs (for example, by trading little), by improving the quality of your portfolio companies and by being opportunistic. However, I believe that every investor has greater control over the time factor (t), by being patient and remaining present in all circumstances on the stock market.'

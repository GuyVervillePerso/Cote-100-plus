        text: 'The phenomenon goes in both directions. When things are going particularly well for the economy, an industry, or a company, it is to be expected that they will eventually return to normal. On the other hand, when things are going badly, we can assume that conditions will improve. The same observation applies to stock markets, as investor sentiment oscillates between the two extremes: euphoria and depression. One thing is certain, the pendulum will tend to continue its movement towards the extremes, positive or negative, before returning towards the middle.'

        text: 'The COVID pandemic that hit the world in 2020 and 2021 gives us a great example. Although it was difficult to predict what the immediate effects of the pandemic would be when it started, the months and quarters that followed clearly created particularly favourable conditions for many businesses (e.g., grocers) and had been very harmful for many other companies (the cruise lines).'

        text: "In managing our portfolios, we have in my view been largely successful in taking advantage of the highly unusual conditions created by the pandemic. One example that comes to mind is Starbucks (but there were others). We had held the stock in our portfolios under management since July 2018 when we acquired it at a rather opportune time at a price just above US$51 per share. A year later, the stock was worth over $90, and we decided to cut our position by almost half, believing that the stock's rebound had probably been too fast, and that its valuation had probably reached a somewhat excessive level."

        text: 'As is often the case, the stock continued to rise in the months that followed (it was worth more than $120 in July 2021), before experiencing a sharp correction in 2022. The containment measures caused by the pandemic in China, where Starbucks has a strong presence, as well as the sharp drop in the stock markets, had an effect on the share price, which fell to almost $75 in the spring of 2022. We thus took advantage of the correction to bring our investment in the stock at a full position in July 2022 at nearly $85.'

        text: "In contrast, we have an opposite example to Starbucks with CarMax, a used car retailer in which we have been shareholders for many years. It turns out that the company initially benefited greatly from the pandemic, with consumers purchasing cars during the time when they couldnâ€™t travel. What's more, the new car production and distribution issues seen during the pandemic forced many buyers to look to the used car market, inflating their prices and CarMax's margins. So, the company's earnings per share jumped to $6.74 in 2022 (fiscal year ending February) from $4.78 in 2019."

        text: 'The mistake we made, at least partially, was to extrapolate such earnings and the unusual market conditions that resulted from the pandemic. A better understanding of the mean reversion phenomenon would have allowed us to assess the situation better and consider a return to more normal margins and profits. We also probably would have reduced our investment in the stock when all was well, and it was worth over $125 at the end of 2021.'

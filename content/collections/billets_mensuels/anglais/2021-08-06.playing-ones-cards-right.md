        text: 'The stock markets are expensive on an historical basis. According to Standard & Poors, the S&P 500 Index, which I consider the best barometer of the North American stock market, is trading at 22.6 times expected earnings in 2021 and 20.5 times those of 2022. The historical average price-earnings ratio is almost 15.0.'

        text: 'However, this data must be put into perspective. Indeed, long-term interest rates are significantly lower than the historical average. Right now, a 10-year US government bond will give you a yield to maturity of just 1.21%. It is therefore quite normal that the valuations of the stock market or any other financial asset are significantly higher than in the past.'

        text: 'That said, traditional bargains are therefore scarce in North American stock markets. The few stocks that sell at low valuation ratios (say, 15.0 or less) are in my opinion “value traps” to be taken with a grain of salt. They are precisely companies of questionable quality that should be avoided by investors.'

        text: 'Rather, I believe the only way to find “opportunities” is to focus on higher quality companies whose securities trade at reasonable valuation ratios. If, for example, you can identify a company of significantly above-market quality and pay a valuation ratio similar to the market, you will likely have an attractive long-term opportunity.'

        text: "There are a few things to consider. On the one hand, for the calculation of “Net profits”, we suggest eliminating any extraordinary item such as, a non-recurring gain from the sale of a real estate asset or a legal charge. In most cases, a company's net profits will yield a figure that approaches its “economic” profits, but sometimes it will be useful to substitute free cash flow for them. Indeed, certain companies, especially those which carry out a lot of acquisitions, post particularly high depreciation charges which mask their true profitability."

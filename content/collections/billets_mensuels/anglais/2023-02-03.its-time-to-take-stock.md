The exercise allows you to see if you are on the way to achieving your long-term financial goals. It also allows us to pinpoint the good decisions we have made as well as the mistakes. The goal is not to question our investment philosophy, but to make some adjustments to it.'

During the first years, it was mainly made up of Quebec small cap securities. Subsequently, we started to include more Canadian securities and towards the end of the 1990s, we began to diversify it more with American securities. Over the years, it has migrated to larger cap stocks, the “blue chips”, but it still has its fair share of mid cap stocks. This portfolio is similar in several ways to our portfolios under management.'

For its part, the S&P/TSX fell by 5.8% (with dividends).'

An initial investment of $100,000 in the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio is therefore worth $4.42 million today.'

Indeed, our companies earn an average return on capital (ROIC), a measure of their profitability, of 18.1% compared to 8.3% for our estimate of the average S&P 500 company. Such a return is rather outstanding and bears witness to the quality of our portfolio companies.'

As I wrote recently, with the sharp rise in interest rates in 2022, conditions have changed drastically in terms of access to capital for companies. In my opinion, those who are in excellent financial health will be greatly advantaged in such an environment. On the whole, our companies will weather a possible recession without too much difficulty, and several of them should be able to take advantage of the difficulties of their competitors.'

        text: "If we made a mistake in 2022 and over the last few years, it was to underestimate the effect of the pandemic on the results of certain companies during the pandemic and in the quarters that followed. Curiously, some companies took advantage of the pandemic, including several technology companies. Among our holdings, CarMax, Enghouse Systems and Netflix are three companies whose profits were somewhat inflated by the pandemic. I believe we misjudged this impact on results and the backlash that would be experienced once confinement conditions returned to normal. In hindsight (and it's always easier after the fact!), we underestimated the impact of the pandemic on the profits of these companies and perhaps should have taken some partial profits on these stocks when everything was going well. Nevertheless, these are securities that we intend to hold for the long term."

        text: "Stock markets have literally exploded in recent months. Since its low reached on October 27, 2023, the S&P\_500 index has rebounded 23.6%. As for the Canadian S&P/TSX index, since the same date, it has appreciated by nearly 14.3%. If we wanted a confirmation that stock markets are unpredictable in the short term, they just gave us another one. This reinforces our conviction that we must always be "

        text: "This strong rebound in stock markets coincides with the recent drop in interest rates. Indeed, as of October 27, the US government's 10-year interest rate stood at 4.85%, roughly its highest level since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. More favourable inflation data in the United States was the factor that pushed interest rates lower, causing stock markets to rebound. As of December 31, 2023, the US government's 10-year interest rate had fallen to 3.87%. In recent weeks, however, the rate for a 10-year bond rebounded to nearly 4.27%."

Real US GDP growth was 2.5% in 2023, including 3.1% in the fourth quarter. In Canada, growth was not as strong, but still positive: 1.1% of real GDP for 2023 and 1.0% in the fourth quarter. Unemployment rates remain low at the end of 2023: 3.7% in the United States and 5.8% in Canada.'

        text: "In my opinion, this data is reflected in the results of the companies we hold in the COTE\_100+ portfolio. As of February 26, 18 of the 25 portfolio companies (72%) had released their quarterly results in the last month; for most of them, these are results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. I believe this is a large enough sample to get an idea of the general progress of the portfolio companies."

For these companies, EPS showed respective annual declines of 36.5% and 49.8%. It seems to me that this is normal because the activities of these companies have been slowed significantly by the rise in interest rates over the last two years. These businesses are dependent on real estate markets, home construction and renovation, or industrial activity.'

        text: "So, if our companies' compound annual EPS growth is 7% over the next 10 years, that means their profits will have roughly doubled over that period. Compound annual growth of around 10% would mean that EPS, on average, would roughly double over the next seven years. If that were the case, don't you think the value of this portfolio should have roughly doubled in seven to ten years?"

This growth will depend in part on unpredictable factors such as economic growth, changes in interest rates and geopolitical events. However, when I consider the companies we own, the sustainability of their business models, their competitive advantages, and their financial health, I do not believe I am wrong in suggesting that their EPS, as a whole, should have doubled ten years from now."

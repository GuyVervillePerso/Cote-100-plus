        text: 'The objective of such a tool is not to do "market timing", to buy or sell at opportune times, but rather to measure the general state of the market and our portfolios, their return potential, and their relative risk level for the next 12 months. In certain cases, we can use this tool to make certain adjustments to our managed portfolios.'

        text: "Let's take the example of a stock that we have in most of our portfolios: Couche-Tard, whose stock is currently trading at close to C$80.25. Our valuation of Couche-Tard stock is currently C$83.50. This is our assessment of the stock 12 months from now based on the earnings we expect over the next year. Including the current dividend, we therefore expect a return of around 4.5% over the next 12 months with Couche-Tard shares."

        text: 'Every valuation is imprecise – valuing a stock is as much an art as it is a science. However, we try to be rigorous and conservative in our evaluations. Also, we seek to remain consistent over the years in our evaluation methods. In short, when you carry out this exercise on more than 25 stocks, I believe that the errors tend to cancel each other out.'

For the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio, we use a similar portfolio under our management. Thus, as of January 30, 2024, this portfolio showed an average expected return of 8.5% for the next 12 months. Is it attractive? How does this compare to past years (we started collecting this data in November 2021):'

        text: "Although this graph doesn't go very far back, I believe it is still informative. On the one hand, we can see that the average expected return during this period was 16.7 %. The current expected return is therefore less attractive than on average over the last three years or so. On the other hand, we see that expected returns were particularly high in 2022, which corresponds to the bear market in American markets in 2022."

        text: 'We do not make buying or selling decisions based on such statistics. But this graph allows us to better measure the temperature of the stock market, its relative attractiveness. I would add that it helps us direct our research towards stocks that would potentially be more attractive at a specific time, depending on whether the markets seem relatively expensive or inexpensive to us.'

        text: 'For example, we believe that stock markets are probably relatively expensive at the moment. This encourages us to look more towards so-called defensive stocks, those stocks which perhaps offer less growth potential, but whose valuation is relatively low – a good example is the stock of Metro. In 2022, it was quite the opposite as the markets corrected sharply: in our opinion it was the time to acquire “growth” stocks (we acquired the stock of Copart, a real “growth” stock, in the fall of 2022 in our private management portfolios).'

We are currently in the midst of an intensive period of publishing results for the quarter that ended in December 2023; in such periods, the valuations of our securities are then likely to be modified based on these results.'

        text: 'Take a good look at the graph that follows. It presents the evolution since 1930 of the average duration of ownership of a security by American investors. In the 1940s and 1950s, the average time was between five and seven years. In 2020, it is less than a year.'

Could it be related to technological developments, to our ability to trade securities instantly on our smartphones, or to the immediate access to information the Internet provides? Or did investors hold onto their securities longer in the 1950s because they had access to little information?'

        text: 'It is the second method we choose to use in our portfolio management to arrive at a calculation of the turnover rate of our portfolios under management. The only caveat is that this formula could give a very different result than the first formula in the event that a portfolio has different positions (i.e., a portfolio that is not equally weighted).'

        text: 'For example, in our private management portfolios, we have sold two securities and acquired a new one since the beginning of 2021, for a total of 3 out of a total number of 28 securities currently in the portfolio. Thus, the portfolio turnover rate for the period would be 11.0% (3/28). Over the past seven years, the turnover rates for this same portfolio have ranged from a low of 7% in 2019 to a high of 26% in 2016. More importantly, the average turnover has been 15.4 % for the period from 2015 to present. This means that we have held our securities for an average period of 6.5 years (1/15.4%). This statistic confirms that we are long-term investors.'

        text: 'First, it is advantageous in terms of costs. The investor who repeatedly buys and sells generally pays a fee for each transaction. Furthermore, in my opinion, it is wrong to believe that online brokerage services offering minimal, or no transaction fees eliminate these costs – they are recovered by reducing other advantages for the investor including zero interest rates or charging high foreign exchange fees.'

Consider two hypothetical portfolios with an initial value of $100,000, portfolio A with a turnover rate of 0% and portfolio B with a turnover rate of 100%. It is assumed that each portfolio obtains a compound annual return of 10% before tax for 20 years, after which the portfolio is liquidated and taxes are paid on the gain realized, and assuming that the gains realized are taxed at a rate of 25%. Here is the value of each portfolio and its after-tax compound annual return after 20 years:'

        text: 'First, the fewer transactions you make, the less chance you have of making costly mistakes. For example, an investor who trades a lot will likely be tempted to enter and exit the stock market, to do what is called “market timing”. This practice is in my opinion particularly dangerous when we know that stock returns often occur over short periods. He could also be tempted by highly speculative securities.'

        text: 'In addition, by necessity, an investor who keeps his securities for a long time will know his companies much better. He will thus be able to concentrate on the better-quality businesses that are more likely to deliver high returns for many years. This is what I see when I examine the securities in the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio. A few high-quality securities of companies such as Couche-Tard, CGI, Copart, Enghouse and Visa have provided us with very attractive returns for many years. If we had sold these securities after achieving a return of “only” 20% or 50%, not only would we have lost a lot of returns, but it is far from certain that we would have succeeded in replacing them with securities that performed as well.'

I believe this is one of the reasons why we not only did not sell anything in March 2020, but also why we then made the decision to increase our investments in many of the stocks we already owned.'

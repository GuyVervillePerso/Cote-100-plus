This index is made up of 505 stocks, but as of October 10, 2023, the seven largest companies in the index represent almost 27.9% of the index, because the index is weighted according to the stock market value of companies that make it up. These seven companies are called the “magnificent seven” and for good reason. See what their returns have been since the start of 2023:'

Such concentration is not necessarily unusual, but the recent stock performance of the largest companies in the index does seem unusual to me.'

This explains the 15.4% return of the S&P 500 since the start of 2023 (as of October 10, in Canadian dollars).'

When their bonuses depend on their returns compared to the S&P 500 index, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, not to buy stocks a few of the “magnificent seven”.'

As it is difficult to invest directly in this sector, they seem to have fallen back on the largest technology companies to take advantage of the potential of this technology. Indeed, to be effective, AI requires a monstrous quantity of data to analyze, which the biggest technologies have.'

However, I will remind them of the story of the “Nifty 50” of the 1970s to show them that we must be careful about “risk-free” decisions that do not require reflection, what the Americans call “no-brainers”.'

Over the past five years, since January 1, 2019, the portfolio's compound annual return has been 8.5%, less than that of the S&P 500 (14.1%, in Canadian dollars) or that of the S&P /TSX (10.1%)."

As a contrarian investor, I am confident that the period of underperformance we have experienced over the past few years will eventually end and that our portfolio long-term returns will remain attractive.'

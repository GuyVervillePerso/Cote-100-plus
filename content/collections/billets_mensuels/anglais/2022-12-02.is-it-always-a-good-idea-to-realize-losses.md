I calculated that no fewer than 59 stocks on the TSX index have fallen by at least 20% since the start of 2022 (as of November 30). That's just over a fifth of the companies making up the S&P/TSX index."

        text: 'Over the past few weeks, a few of our investors have asked us to sell some securities from their portfolio before the end of the year in order to realize losses and reduce, or eliminate, the tax bill they will have to pay in 2023. Obviously, the sales relate to the securities that lost the most value in 2022 within our portfolios under management.'

The opposite is also true: yesterday's winners will often be tomorrow's losers. This is the phenomenon of reversion to the mean, and it is ubiquitous in the stock market."

This is why when we sell a security to take a loss, our intention is to buy it back as soon as the 30 days prescribed by Canadian tax law have elapsed.'

Its current book value is $50,000, which means you have an unrealized gain of $50,000. However, during the year 2022, you made a gain of $10,000 by selling a security that you had owned for a long time."

You like the stock and believe it offers strong and attractive return potential over the next few years. For tax reasons, you choose to sell it and buy it back in 30 days. The result is that you have eliminated your earnings for the year 2022 and therefore will not have to pay tax next year.'

In the event of a rapid rebound in the markets during this period (on November 10 alone, the US index jumped 5.5%), the performance of your portfolio will likely be affected. If instead of selling just one of your portfolio securities to eliminate the gain made, you were to sell several of them, you will temporarily find yourself with an even more unbalanced portfolio and an even higher level of cash.'

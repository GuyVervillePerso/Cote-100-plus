Warren Buffett, 92, and Charlie Munger, 99, were in great shape, if not physically, certainly mentally. They answered for six hours more than 50 questions from company shareholders.'

Jokes aside, Messrs. Munger and Buffett are as insightful and knowledgeable as ever.'

        text: 'Obviously, the acquisition of all the shares of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 is a major milestone for Mr. Buffett – we can say that everything really began with this acquisition. That said, Mr. Buffett considers the acquisition of Berkshire Hathaway a mistake! Indeed, the textile industry not only required a lot of capital but had low barriers to entry (difficult to raise prices) besides facing fierce competition. At the time the factories in the Southern States of the United States became very competitive, with the invention of air conditioning systems; later, it was foreign manufacturers who upset the whole industry.'

        text: 'In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway provided an exceptional structure for Mr. Buffett to create long-term shareholder value. With such a structure, he never had to worry about his shareholders withdrawing their money and capital from the company when returns were not there. He could thus focus exclusively on creating long-term value for its shareholders. For example, an investment fund manager has no such luxury and always faces the possibility of his investors withdrawing their marbles at the worst times (in market downturns). It also gave Mr. Buffett great freedom of action, who then had the possibility of buying not only shares of companies on the stock market, but also shares of private companies.'

Not only did Berkshire not have to pay interest on this capital (unlike the banks for their deposits), but could reinvest some of it, much at high rates of return thanks to Buffett's genius as an investor."

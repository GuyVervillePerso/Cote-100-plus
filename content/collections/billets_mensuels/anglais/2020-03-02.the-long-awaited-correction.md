    text: 'How is it that so many questions are asked when the markets fall and almost none when they go up?At the time of this writing, the S&P 500 has lost, in a few days, more than it had gained since the start of the year. All we hear about is COVID-19 and investor concern is palpable. Perhaps the coronavirus is the pretext that many investors have been waitingfor to sell after several successful years on the stock market?How should the investor react in such situations?First would be not to react, to simply do nothing. The markets have regularly experienced corrections in the past; sometimes they turn into bear markets. It’s impossible to say whether the recent decline will continue.Do you remember the last near correction at the end of 2018? I bet many of you haveforgotten it. However, when we were in the middle of it, that’s all we talked about. The S&P 500 had lost 9.9% of its value in the last weeks of the year. It wasn’t missing much for it to reach 10%, the level of an “official” correction. I know investors who had panicked and decided to sell everything in December 2018. Imagine the returns theylost. (The S&P 500 recorded a return of more than 31% in 2019.) In my opinion, the downturn in the markets in 2018 was caused by a rise in interest rates which hinted at the possibility of an economic slowdown.Today, the cause is different, but investors are nevertheless concerned about the economic slowdown that COVID-19 could cause. The media hype surrounding the situation certainly doesn’t help.Here are some facts that I think could make one put into question the scope of COVID-19. The numbers brandished by the media are scary, hence the importance of putting things into perspective. I am currently reading a very interesting book on this subject, Enlightenment Now, by Steven Pinker.One of the chapters talks about terrorism in the world, a subject which, in some ways, is a little bit like an epidemic, if only for the fact that the two often cause much more fear than harm. In both cases, people fear a ripple effect or the contagion.Here are some statistics the author presents in order to put the risk of terrorism into perspective. The table shows the number of deaths related to various risks. I only took the numbers for the United States for 2014:'

        text: " a book by Messrs. Bradley, Hirt and Smit, three consultants from McKinsey Strategy Practice. What I particularly liked about the book is that it presents an overarching framework for business leaders to benchmark their company's performance against that of others. Indeed, as the authors point out, one of the most common mistakes made by boards of directors and business leaders, especially of smaller private companies, is to evaluate their performance in a vacuum. They rarely, if ever, compare themselves to other companies in their industry, much less to companies in general. In such a situation, how do you know where your company is in terms of profitability compared to its peers and to all companies?"

Competitive forces exert inexorable pressure on companies that generate such excess profits, pushing the vast majority of companies towards zero economic profit (ROIC = cost of capital). Few companies therefore generate a positive economic profit year after year and even rarer are those which manage to obtain an ROIC significantly higher than their long-term cost of capital.'

        text: ' is that it goes beyond theory and that it presents us with an empirical framework. The authors used a McKinsey database of 2,393 of the largest companies around the world for the five-year period 2010 to 2014. For this period, the average company in the group recorded a profit of US$921 million. The average total invested capital for all the companies was $9.3 billion, which translates into an ROIC of approximately 9.9%. The authors calculated that the total cost of capital of these companies was 8.0%, on average. This means that the entire group had managed to generate an economic profit of some $180 million or an ROIC above the cost of capital by 1.9%.'

In the graph, quintiles II, III and IV represent 1,951 companies, or 81.5% of the total sample studied by McKinsey. Such a conclusion is consistent with the fact that fierce competition in the economy virtually eliminates any economic profit."

As is the case in the world of professional tennis where we see a few headliners monopolizing most of the revenue, a minority of companies are particularly profitable and monopolize a disproportionate portion of the profits of their sector and the economy as a whole. For the investor, this conclusion is a strong incentive to concentrate its investments in the few companies of the highest quality. A good way to ensure this is to focus your investments on companies with an average return on capital of at least 10%, and ideally 15% or more, over many years.'

Investors should therefore make a point of favouring such companies and above all, if one is lucky enough to own a few, keep them as long as possible. Obviously, these securities rarely sell at reasonable valuation ratios – our job is to identify them and wait for opportunities to buy them at good prices.'

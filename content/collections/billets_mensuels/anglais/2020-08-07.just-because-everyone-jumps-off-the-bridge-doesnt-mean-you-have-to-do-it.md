After taking a quick tour of the village, you realize that there are only two restaurants, one next to the other, on the main street. The two establishments don’t look like much, but you notice that one of the two seems rather deserted while there’s a line of ten people waiting at the other's door. Which one will you choose?"

For many investors, the crowd pull is just too strong, especially when they''re making money. In my opinion, this is happening with the big US tech companies and several of the hottest tech companies of the day. I would be tempted to put gold in the same group.'

Thus, when several psychological effects act together and feed on one another, we can then witness large-scale movements on the stock market (or elsewhere), in what he calls the "lollapalooza" effect.'

In the housing bubble of 2007, the popular discourse maintained that house prices couldn’t go down.'

The COVID pandemic has confirmed and reinforced what many investors have believed in recent years: tech stocks, especially very large companies, are immune to business cycles. While the tech sector has always been characterized as cyclical and discretionary, it’s now believed that many parts of the tech sector are not only sectors where rapid growth will continue, but that they are no longer really affected by the economic context. Nothing can touch them, not even a pandemic. There are, however, risks for these companies, the most important of which is undoubtedly increased regulation by governments. The Nifty Fifty episode of the 1970s showed us what can happen when the securities of dominant companies sell at overpriced ratios. At that time, it was customary to say that "nobody was going to lose their job for buying IBM equipment". Obviously, things are not set in stone.'

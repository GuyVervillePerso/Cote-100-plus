    text: "What's yours?Perhaps you’re a \"technical investor\" who relies primarily on stock charts. You've developed your own method over the years and it works pretty well for you.Or perhaps you’re trying to profit from the securities of companies operating in high growth sectors, even if it means paying a high price for these securities? You’d then be called a “growth” investor. Or you take advantage of market trends, waves and the “momentum” that you see in the stock markets.Or are you one of those looking for valuable bargains, trying to unearth neglected securities that are trading well below the value of their tangible assets. You’d be called a \"value\" investor.It doesn't matter. I've always believed that there are almost as many ways to invest as there are investors. In fact, two investors might have exactly the same investment philosophy, but if you looked at their respective portfolios, you’d see that they’re largely made up of different companies. In addition, the number of securities and the diversification of their portfolio could very well be poles apart. I know of several portfolio managers who apply an investment philosophy very similar to that of COTE 100, but you wouldn't know it by comparing our portfolios.In my opinion, an investor's style of investing should be as close as possible to that investor's personality, financial goals and tolerance for risk. If you’re a change-minded person who enjoys making quick decisions, perhaps a technical analysis or \"momentum\" approach is right for you? If, on the other hand, you’re a patient person, who seeks to follow the development and long-term growth of companies that you’ve taken the time to know and analyze, the \"Buy and Hold”method is more appropriate. If you don't have the time, the knowledge, or the inclination to spend too much time studying corporate stocks or stock charts, perhaps you’re destined to be an investor for the long term who’ll buy index funds for the next 30 years? You’d then be considered a \"passive\" investor.There aren't really any bad ways to invest. I would say, however, that many investors aren’t sure what kind of investor they are. In many other cases, they may have established their method of investing, but they constantly deviate from it.Whatever your style, what matters is to stick to that style at all times, year in, year out, in all types of stock markets. The worst thing you can do is to constantly change track, a good way to never reach the destination.I like to use tennis as an analogy for investing. However, I believe that sooner or later playershave to find the style of play that best suits their personality, that exploits their physical and technical qualities and that minimizes the impact of their shortcomings. Thus, some players will develop a defensive style. For these players, speed, regularity of strokes and patience will be the main ingredients of success. Other players will develop an attacking game that relies on a powerful first serve and repeated moves to the net in an effort to put constant pressure on their opponent. There’s a wide variety of styles of play and each player is unique.But the worst thing I think players can do is change their style of play at every tournament. Or worse, in the middle of a game. Of course, it may be appropriate to make adjustments to theirstrategy depending on the conditions, the opponent's style, or how successful (or unsuccessful) they’ve been since the start of a match. But these changes should be subtle, and they shouldn't drastically divert from their natural playstyle.It's the same on the stock market. An investor should spend a lot of time studying the various ways to invest and choosing the style that suits him/her best. Once this style has been chosen, itshould be maintained for the long term and not deviated from too much because of changing market conditions or what’s working at a specific time on a given market.We all tend to want to emulate those who are successful. We hear of a \"stock market dabbler\" who’s made a fortune in recent months and we’re tempted to try to do the same. Our neighbour made a lot of money investing in the latest tech company to make the jump to the stock market - why don't I do like him next time? This is, in my opinion, the best way to severely burn yourself on the stock market.Better to choose your style carefully and stick to it for the long haul."

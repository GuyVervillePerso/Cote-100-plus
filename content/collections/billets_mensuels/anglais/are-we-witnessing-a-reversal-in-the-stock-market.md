title: 'Are we witnessing a reversal in the stock market?'
chapeau: 'The COTE 100 Newsletter portfolio appreciated by 5.2% in July, bringing its return since the beginning of 2024 to 8.7% (as of July 31). I am not accustomed to commenting on short-term returns, but in this case, this statistic seems noteworthy.'

Since that date, it has been mainly the mega-cap stocks in the index that have taken a hit, particularly the “magnificent seven”:'

It is probably too early to confirm a market reversal, but I remain convinced that the performance of the magnificent seven will be lower than that of the rest of the stock market over the coming years.'

Although the company has shown excellent financial performance over the past twenty years, we have been disappointed with its results over the past five years. Between 2019 and today, revenues have recorded a compound annual growth rate of only 7.2%. Furthermore, earnings per share (EPS) have increased from $1.42 to $1.49, a compound annual growth rate of only 1.1%. By using 2019 as the base year, we exclude the pandemic period which artificially inflated revenues and EPS in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the stock has disappointed over the past five years: five years ago, the stock was worth more than $38, while today it is worth just under $31.'

Despite the stock’s decline since then, we now recommend selling it. The company’s financial performance is disappointing, and its balance sheet has notably deteriorated since the acquisition of Uni-Select. We also have doubts about its ability to restructure its European operations, due to the strict regulations characterizing this continent.'

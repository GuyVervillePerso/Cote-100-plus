        text: 'In my opinion, it is important to highlight the dominance of American indexes over the past year. As indicated by the extraordinary performance of the NASDAQ index, which is largely composed of technology companies, it is especially the stocks of this industry which dominated stock market performances in 2023. This is perhaps a fair return of the pendulum as it was these same stocks which suffered the most during the fall of the markets in 2022.'

If I were a passive investor, I would try to increase international stocks somewhat in the composition of my portfolio. It is above all a question of the phenomenon of “reversion to the mean”: one day or another the best stock market performances will move outside the United States.'

However, it is still in the United States where we find the greatest number of high-quality companies, leaders in their industry.'

        text: 'Furthermore, in my opinion, we must put the performance of American indexes into perspective, particularly in recent years because it has been fuelled largely by a handful of stocks. Thus, if we excluded what observers now call the “magnificent seven” (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), the return on the S&P 500 (according to Bloomberg*) would have been 15.4% in 2023. Since March 31, 2015 (the date the index calculated by Bloomberg began), it would have been 9.4% on a compound annual basis.'

However, in the long term, history shows us that it is only a matter of time before a dominant company is one day obsolete or relegated to oblivion. I am thinking of companies such as General Electric, Xerox, Nortel, Cisco, Intel, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia and so on.'

Projecting a compound annual growth rate of 10% per year over the next 10 years, the company's revenues would approach $1.0\_trillion, and its capitalization would exceed $7.5\_trillion. To put things in perspective, the size of the Canadian economy is approximately $2.1\_trillion; that of the European Union is nearly $19.5\_billion."

This is without mentioning the regulations which will probably increase.'

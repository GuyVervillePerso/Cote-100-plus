I am particularly proud of this and take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the leaders of Couche-Tard who have done a remarkable job for so long.'

        text: 'In December 2001, we recommended and purchased Couche-Tard stock in the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio at an adjusted price of $1.0313 per share (adjusted for several subsequent splits). The stock is worth $67.93 today, which with dividends represents a compound annual return of 22.2%. In other words, our initial investment of $13,634.50 in Couche-Tard in December 2001, assuming no subsequent transactions and without taking dividends into account, would be worth close to $900,000 today!'

We know that the key to success in the stock market is to hold on to your stocks of quality companies for a long, long time. But there is an ocean between knowing and doing.'

After just over a year, the value of your investment has only increased by 5%.'

Also, management has remained disciplined, always buying at a reasonable price, and maintaining a solid balance sheet. After the major acquisitions, it worked to quickly reduce the company's debt."

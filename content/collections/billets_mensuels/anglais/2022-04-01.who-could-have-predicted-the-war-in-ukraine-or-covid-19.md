        text: 'The majority of brokerage firms and financial newspapers have the habit of making annual forecasts in January of each year. For example, I remember reading a report in Bloomberg Businessweek magazine, published on January 17th. The report was very well done and very comprehensive and presented a myriad of forecasts covering many areas, ranging from the end of economic stimuli to the American midterm elections, to inflation, to the future of electric cars. The problem is that their analysts did not foresee that a war would break out in Ukraine a few weeks later. This one event simply made most of their forecasts obsolete.'

This major event was the main influencing factor on the stock markets in the many months that followed. Any analysis of the markets that did not anticipate this pandemic immediately became inconsequential.'

        text: "The point is that it is usually useless to attempt to make annual stock market forecasts. Even with a comprehensive analysis of all known factors that could affect the markets, it is impossible to predict the unexpected. And that's usually what will have the biggest impact on short-term stock market returns."

        text: "Although it is a great humanitarian tragedy, I would not put the Russian-Ukrainian war in the same category as the two previous events. Still, very few people foresaw this major conflict in early 2022. Russia's invasion of Ukraine officially took place on February 24, but the risk of an invasion became apparent several months before that with the Russian armed forces having deployed some 100,000 troops to Ukraine's border as early as November 2021. Between January 4, 2022, and March 8, 2022, the S&P 500 lost 14.4%. It has rebounded strongly since then, with the index just 4.0% off its current year high at the time of this writing."

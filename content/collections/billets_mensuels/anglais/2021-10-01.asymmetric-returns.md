        text: 'When investing in a stock market, the maximum that can be lost is 100%, while the potential gain is theoretically infinite. This is called the asymmetry of stock returns.'

        text: "From time to time, one of your stocks in the portfolio experiences stock market hiccups – this is currently the case with Alibaba's stock in the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio. It is still too early to comment on the success or failure of our investment in Alibaba, but we must keep things in perspective: for each losing security, we will generally have a winning one and the value of this winning security could potentially be multiplied several times. Such a stock will compensate many times for the poor performance of a losing one."

        text: 'The other facet of asymmetric returns is the very basis of the "value" investing philosophy. This consists of identifying securities whose price is significantly lower than the valuation an investor will conservatively make of them.'

        text: 'If you can successfully find and invest in a security priced at, say, $50 while you value it at $75, your future returns will become even more asymmetric. By buying this security at a discount of more than 30% of your appraisal of its intrinsic value, you are giving yourself a comfortable margin of safety. Thus, if you have made a mistake in your valuation of the security in question, your risk of loss should be limited by this margin of safety. On the other hand, if you are right, your earning potential is substantial and amplified by the attractive price you will have paid.'

        text: "The recent stock market decline in Alibaba's stock reminds me of a situation we faced shortly after purchasing Booking Holdings stock on behalf of our private wealth management clients. In late February 2020, we acquired our first shares of this company operating various electronic platforms for travel and accommodation at a price of approximately $1,680. By then, the coronavirus had started to spread internationally, but government containment measures had yet to be enacted. At the time of our acquisition, the share price had already fallen by nearly 20% and seemed attractive to us. In addition, our valuation of approximately $2,000 per share gave us an attractive margin of safety in case we made a valuation error. As a matter of fact, we had underestimated the drastic intervention of governments to counter the coronavirus. A month later, our customers were recording a 30% paper loss. Nevertheless, confident in our assessment of the stock and the quality of the company's business model, we kept our shares and were still able to sell them in January 2021 at a price of almost $2,200 (in our opinion, the pandemic was changing the long-term outlook for the tourism industry)."

        text: "The CarMax stock comes to mind because it has done particularly well on the stock market in recent months. We recommended and acquired this used car retailer’s stock in May 2014 at close to US$43.50. However, almost two years later, it had returned to about the same price. Then, in the fall of the markets in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the stock fell to nearly US$54.00, not much more than the price we paid six years earlier! Today, CarMax stock is trading at US$130, around three times the original price paid for the stock in 2014. More importantly, the company's earnings per share have risen from US$2.93 in 2014 (its fiscal year ends in February) to US$6.92 in the past 12 months."

        text: 'When I examine the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio, the concept of asymmetric returns jumps out at me. Of the 23 stocks in the portfolio, only two showed a drop in relation to our purchase cost, while twelve gave us returns of at least 100% and, in a few cases, well above 100% (our best investment has given us a return of 4,836% since January 2002; do you know which one?).'

Securities such as Couche-Tard, CGI, Canadian National, Dollar General, Visa, Enghouse Systems or CarMax. It is these securities, along with others that we no longer have in our portfolio, that have enabled the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio to post an annual compound return of 12.0% since 1988.'

        text: 'One of the objectives of the COTE 100+ platform was to submit more stock recommendations to our subscribers. We presented 25 securities to our readers in the last 30 months, which brings us close to our goal of averaging one stock recommendation per month. Of those 25 Spotlights, 24 were buy recommendations.'

        text: 'Also, I’d qualify 38% of “Spotlight” featured companies as mid-cap (US $5 billion or less), the rest featured large-cap companies. The largest recommended company, Berkshire Hathaway, currently has a market cap of nearly US$535 billion; the smallest one, Solium Capital, had a market value of approximately C$600 million at the time of our recommendation.'

        text: 'The recommended companies represented six different industries: 25% in the industrial sector, 25% in the financial sector, 21% in technology, 13% in consumer discretionary, 13% in consumer staples and 4% in the health sector. As you know, because we’re long-term investors, we’ve little interest in highly cyclical companies, which generally causes us to avoid companies in the natural resources sector.'

        text: 'What’s probably more important are the average returns obtained by these 24 recommendations. Of the 24 recommended stocks, only four (17%) have so far recorded a negative return compared to their price at the time of publication. And these are minor declines, the worst being a 7.2% drop. Sixteen of them (67%) had a return of 10% or more. An investor who would have invested $10,000 in each of the 24 recommended stocks would today have a portfolio worth $295,573, which equates to a 23.2% return (excluding dividends). Furthermore, several were recommended before the pandemic.'

        text: 'The COTE 100+ platform offers us greater flexibility and allows us to propose more securities recommendations to PLATINUM subscribers and to regularly present the analysis of a security suggested by our subscribers via the “COTE 100 on demand” feature. We presented 17 “COTE 100 on demand” reports, most of which resulted in hold recommendations, two led to buy recommendations and two to sell recommendations. The fact of not systematically buying each recommended security in the COTE 100 Financial Bulletin portfolio gives us greater flexibility than in the past, when we added each of the recommended securities to the portfolio, which, in some ways, is contrary to our philosophy of long-term investing.'

        text: 'Our goal is to average one buy recommendation per month to our COTE 100+ Platinum subscribers. This goal is more difficult to achieve when the markets are relatively expensive, as they are now. However, I believe that this goal is beneficial to both our subscribers and our private wealth management clients as it forces us to continually seek opportunities in the stock markets. It encourages us to look outside North America for attractive opportunities for our investors.'

I think that you just need to be right a little more often than you’re wrong. The key is to not lose too much when you’re wrong. We look forward to continuing to provide you with great recommendations in the months to come."

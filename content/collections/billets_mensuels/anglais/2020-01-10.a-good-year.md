In my opinion, this requirement has probably cost the portfolio returns. It’s better to keep your securities for a very long time and minimize transactions.'

In the first case, we bought it in April 2013 at $91.30 and sold it in 2014 at $108.00 to make room for another security; it’s worth almost $267 today. The second was purchased in December 2013 for $49.06. We sold it in 2018 at $109.06 because we thought it was overvalued. It is now worth more than $155.'

Despite everything, we were able to keep certain securities for many years. The average portfolio security has been held for more than five years.'

This means that the value of our initial investment has increased almost 40-fold. It should be noted that the returns on the securities shown in the table exclude the dividends we received from these companies. However, these are not negligible: for example, Couche-Tard now pays an annual dividend of C$0.50 per share, which represents 48.4% of our initial cost!'

Such rates significantly increase the valuation of high-growth companies, while encouraging risk-taking by investors.'

This was definitely the case during the first quarter that ended in March when the company deployed a net amount of US$41.4 billion (all data that follows is in US dollars) of its cash in investments. Berkshire agreed to acquire Alleghany Corporation, an insurance company, for $11.6 billion. It increased its investment in Chevron (oil industry) by nearly $14 billion, acquired some 14 % of Occidental Petroleum (petroleum industry) for a sum we estimate at $4 billion and invested just over $4.0 billion in shares of the computer products and services company HP.'

It was therefore decades of preparation that led to a transaction concluded in a few days!"

We saw an unprecedented wave of speculators opening online brokerage accounts in recent years to engage in day trading, an upsurge in initial public offerings (IPOs), often in the form of “SPAC” (Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation), “meme” stocks, etc. For Munger and Buffett, the stock market of recent years resembled a “gambling parlour”. According to them, it is this “casino” aspect of the stock market and the volatility it has created over the past few months that allowed them to suddenly invest $40 billion at good prices in the most recent quarter.'

Mr. Icahn had tried to change the Occidental president, without success. He chose to sell his position which represented nearly 10% of the company's shares and were largely bought at a good price by Buffett. Buffett already knew Occidental Petroleum very well since Berkshire has owned preferred shares of the company for several years (purchased when it wanted to finance the acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum)."

I believe that Buffett had just such a moment during the 1970s thanks to Charlie Munger when he realized that it was much better to invest in high quality companies at a reasonable price than in ordinary companies at an extraordinary price. You could also say he had another Eureka moment around 2016 when he started investing in Apple, a “tech” company that would previously have been considered outside his circle of expertise. The move created enormous wealth for Berkshire shareholders: the value of its investment in the stock was over $161 billion at the end of 2021.'

Jokingly, Buffett says that in those years his parents, who were very Republican, required their children to say something negative about President Roosevelt (a Democrat) if they wanted dessert! According to Buffett, such “tribalism” is not a positive development for society. I would add that strong opinions based only on information that confirms what one thinks are dangerous. This is one of the great problems of social networks, whose algorithms mainly feed us with opinions and facts that confirm our initial ideas.'

One of the examples he gave was American Express, of which Berkshire has not bought any further shares since 1998, but whose ownership percentage has since increased from 11.9% to almost 20% thanks to regular share repurchases by the company."

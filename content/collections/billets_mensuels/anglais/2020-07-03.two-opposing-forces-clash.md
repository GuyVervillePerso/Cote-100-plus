        text: "As soon as last March, when it became clear that the pandemic was going to have a major negative economic impact, Western governments didn’t hesitate to inject record amounts to revive the economy and ensure the proper functioning of markets worldwide. It must be said that they had benefited from a first rehearsal during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. This time, however, there were no hesitations and they didn’t go with kid gloves, as the following graph illustrates. You’ll notice that the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet had increased from nearly $1.0 trillion before the 2009 crisis to surpass $4.0 trillion by 2014. In a few months, the pandemic forced the Fed to increase this amount to more than $7.0 trillion."

This is reflected in the level of federal debt relative to the size of the economy. You’ll see that these are unprecedented historic interventions by the United States government. The same holds true for other western governments, including the Canadian government.'

        text: 'Another significant factor is the substantial drop in interest rates in recent months. As the graph below shows, the yield on a 10-year US government bond is currently just over 0.62%, its lowest level in over a hundred years. One of the factors behind the rate cut was the massive purchases of US government bonds by the Federal Reserve. Another factor is the expectation of weak economic growth in the coming years due to the pandemic. One thing is certain, such rates greatly favour stock prices as well as the valuation of any other financial asset. What other investment alternatives are there than the stock market for investors?'

Also you can see that the United States has lost more jobs in a few weeks than all those created in the last 10 years, since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. However, it should be noted that the below graphic does not account for the vigorous rebound of the employement in the past weeks due to the gradual reopening of many regions.'

There is an economic rebound everywhere, resulting from the deconfinement initiatives of several governments. But who knows if the deconfinement won’t result in a second wave of contagion, which could lead to new confinement measures? The arrival of an effective vaccine will probably be the solution to the pandemic, but who can say when it will happen?'

That said, caution remains the watchword. In addition, I believe that an investor should expect lower returns than historically over the next few years. This is why we advocate an even more defensive strategy than the one we usually practice. In most of our portfolios under management, our cash level is currently close to 10% of the portfolio (incidentally, this also means that 90% of the portfolio remains invested!).'

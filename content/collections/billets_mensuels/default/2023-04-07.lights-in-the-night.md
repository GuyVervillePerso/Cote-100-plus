Markel's management has an investment philosophy very similar to Buffett's: invest in quality companies at a reasonable price and hold them for a long time."

Sometimes investment markets go up a lot and nobody (including us) describes up years as “volatile” even though it seems like the same word should apply”.'

I'm thinking specifically of the opportunity we had to buy Copart stock for most of our clients last fall. After years of waiting, the bear market of 2022 finally allowed us to acquire this high-quality company at a reasonable price. For this reason alone, we must appreciate our ally, volatility."

So, I am pleased to see that most companies we hold in our portfolios under management are doing well. I estimate that, on average, their earnings grew 15.9% in the latest quarter. Also, almost all of them are in excellent financial health.'
